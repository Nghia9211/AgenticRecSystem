        "text": "So I'm very much enthused with Sean Murphy's take on the Batman. His Punk Rock Jesus was original (despite some of its flaws) and his art in Detective Comics #27 and The Wake were way too good to look at. Batman: White Knight is an Elseworlds story that explores the thesis about Batman being the true villain of Gotham, and the only person who can stop him, the legal way is Joker, the White Knight. \n Murphy's art is undeniably good. \n I totally buy Joker being the only person who has the capability of stopping Batman since he knows him well an in fact is in love with the Caped Crusader. Well, that idea could work, and who knows what he's going to do in the legal world. The stage is already set in issue one and Murphy only has to play the right moves with the right pieces to make this 8-issue series truly memorable. \n What I don't buy is how can the whole Gotham, or at least those who are taking Joker in custody, to permit him to roam around the city guilt-free as if he's become the new hero Gotham needs. It would still take me some convincing to believe how the one-year span made the Clown Prince of Crime to a serious Harvey Dent-ish guy with a hero complex. Although \n Murphy's art as what I've said is great as always. His edgy style that is coupled by dark color contrasts really sets the mood of the story. This alone is makes White Knight worth buying. \n I still have my reservations with the series, though I am highly optimistic that White Knight is going to be one of those good Batman stories and not just a forgettable arc.",

As you read these issues, you also see a glimpse of what happened and how it connects to the main DC Metal series. \n The strongest aspect of these evil Batmen tie-ins is that they are fvckin' enjoyable to read. It's an all hell break loose, one helluva ride damn good type of stories. Dawnbreaker is yet another fine addition to this. It is so damn good and terrifying it reads as a horror stor story \n This Dawnbreaker has so much willpower the ring wasn't able to take it. \n Dawnbreaker kills, like what the other evil Batmen do. He doesn't care about who to kill, villain or good person. His constructs are amazingly horrific too. I cannot wait for his bout against the leaguers. \n Dawnbreaker is another great addition to the growing collection of DC Metal titles. It deserves a \"rock on!\" status. Oh yeah.",

This issue concludes the series and man it is a fitting Alfred-centric story that touches on father-son and legacy themes that touched my heart. \n The story at the end also ties up with the main First Ally arc, though it is pretty bland and generic. \n All-Star Batman has its ups and downs.

        "text": "Tie-in comics in my experience have a reputation of far from being good compared with the main events. Snyder's main Court and City of Owls were overwhelmingly good while the Night of the Owls tie-in stories were just mediocre with some truly standing out (like Nightwing's Gray Son of Gotham). So aside from having a delicious collection of foil-covered evil Batmen origin stories, there's really none I expect these comics would be, but so far the issues are surprisingly great and super enjoyable. \n The Murder Machine tells the origin of Cyborg-Batman from the Dark Multiverse, a darker, underground version of the multiverse where everything is doomed to destruction. The story combines a twisted version of a son-father relationship between Bruce and Alfred with elements from The Matrix and Age of Ultron to deliver a horrifying take on the theme \"machine power and its dangerous capabilities without a human heart\". \n Building from the Red Death, The Murder Machine continues to intrigue its readers on Earth-0's \"darkification\" and maybe its eventual demise. It seems that these evil Batmen will all have their particular roles to do. \n Federici's art is always sure and calculated, with some panels reminding me of 80s art in books. His illustrations of The Murder Machine is superb.",

        "text": "DC has a a cool way of making the readers follow and buy event-related comics. Important Rebirth titles are slapped with lenticular covers while essential Metal comics are appropriately covered in foil. So far, it works for me. I'm happy to say that these titles are pretty entertaining and fresh. \n Di Giandomenico's kinetic art style explodes in this issue. Everything is in beautiful chaos. \n So if you have been reading DC Metal, seven evil Batmen are introduced in issue two (please do read Metal!), forging seven tie-in/origin stories of these characters. And what I can say is that these evil Batmen origin one-shots kicks of with an explosive start! Red Death, the baddie amalgamation of Batman and The Flash starts to wreck havoc and murder in an alternative universe where the bad ultimately wins. \n This Red Death story offers some clues to what would be the motivation of these Batmen and why the came to Earth-0 (DC's main universe) and also drops a couple of mysteries along the way. For starters, is this DC Metal cataclysm has a direct connection with Crisis of Infinite Earths? Though we did see the Anti-Monitor tower in Dark Days: The Forge Then this guy Doctor Fate did something here, so are there any connections to what transpired with Morrison's The Multiversity? Which, although a more far-fetched idea, are we going to see some more of the Endless aside from Dream? The possibilities are endless and very exciting. \n And I have completely forgotten about Red Death himself. This guy, man, whenever he runs, bats of death literally fly instead of lightning trails. Di Giandomenico's kinetic art is spectacular. It explodes and bursts in every panel. This issue deserves at least two re-reads just for the art alone.",

Of course in the end, Superman would stand on defending the people of the world and with head held up high say that he's the beacon of hope, truth and justice. \n This cover really reminds me of something. \n Issue 988 does not have anymore the element of mystery since Oz's identity was revealed last issue. Instead, it relies on keeping the interest of its readers by telling his backstory. Though majority of his story revolves around him being brainwashed by all types of History channel documentaries about war and being stuck in a war-torn place, the issue places some more evidences on what extent is Dr. Manhattan's influence over the DC universe and who he is working it.

        "text": "To give credit where credit is due, Marvel Legacy #1 is an easy and enjoyable read, keeping things on the safe side of the story and promising to bring back things that has been lost like its other brother DC in its earlier DC Universe Rebirth. But its lackluster narrative and flawed marketing make this initiative more of a cash grab lure than a genuinely empathizing comics fans desperately yearn for these recent years. \n Can Marvel just let us readers breath and cherish the moment first before bombarding us with a ton of Legacy comics? \n It is impossibly hard not to compare Legacy with Rebirth, for both stories aim for the same things like addressing the ramifications of the not-so-good things these two comics giants have done over the recent years and turn them all into good ones (diversity, killing-off characters, neglecting others, those types of things) that would hopefully bring old and new readers alike into believing into comics again. But if there's one thing Legacy falls short of, it is emotion. DC Rebirth is so full of it I cried the first few times reading it. Legacy on the other hand brings excitement and promise but felt bland in comparison. Sure there are things that a reader should be very, very excited about in Legacy, but that \"cliffhanger\" feeling is not that special, just the same with other interesting comic book teases. \n It is good to see a couple of illustrators lashing out their artistic talent here, but consistency is my biggest issue. Esad Ribic's kind and subdued drawings (which I do love by the way) do not really mesh up nicely with other art styles. For an event this big, they clearly should have addressed this one. \n Marvel Legacy is one big tease for what Marvel comics has to offer. This I can definitely say is not a line-wide reboot, but an initiative that makes Marvel pull itself up by its own bootstrap. But man, I don't think i can keep up with this publisher's marketing campaign. Can they just let the readers breath and cherish the moment first before bombarding them with a ton of Legacy comics? Take it easy, Marvel. \n After a barrage of event misfires, Marvel Legacy finally makes their universe more interesting and engaging with promises and reveals that will hopefully turn into good stories but it does not succeed in bringing the heart and greatness in what they can truly offer.",

The writing is both crisp, clean, easy to follow and at the same time engaging and funny. \n It's in the light moments that this issue really shines. Whether it is the New Genesis hotel room or a parademon army barracks, Tom King made sure that each page is perfectly executed and told. Mitch Gerads art is also something to point out here.

His unique take on this Batcentric story does not traverse universes like Geoff Johns' Green Lantern or The Crisis on Infinite Earths. It is a dense and grounded story both literal and figuratively as members of the justice league figure out what the hell is happening in their world. Yes, dense is the word that can effectively describe this issue. Metal #2 is full to the brim with DC's history as the story explores uncharted terrain. It is a beautiful clusterf*ck of then, now and the future. It is oh so beautiful to experience. \n There's a squad pose like this in this issue, only ten times better. \n I love how Metal is very much self-aware of its rock and roll heavy metal theme (that dominates both DC comics and the DCEU marketing strategy). From the creative team rock star monikers to hidden hand horns to the smoke-filled squad pose of the evil Batmen, Dark Nights Metal #2 is the closest comics can get to hearing heavy metal. Snyder and Capullo does not veer away from this theme, it embraces it fully without reservations. Once the reader gets over that absurdity shock and noise, they will be in one helluva ride.",

        "text": "The thing is, I feel like that I don't deserve to review this high-caliber literary piece. Alan Moore has once again truly crafted a haunting and genuinely good story in graphic medium. Providence may not be a comics for all readers, but reading this from start to end is definitely an experience which is both grotesquely unique and horrifyingly beautiful. \n Providence Act 3 concludes Robert Black's excursion in search of the occult and mystical, in the end discovering way, way more than what he could handle. Without really spoiling too much, I can say that the last act leads to a deliverance from the waking world, revolving around an abundant number of Lovecraftian elements. \n Reading Providence is a truly unique experience. \n There is a significant number of pages where my mind really meanders away from the main material, partly because I cannot comprehend both the dialogue and lore and partly because I want to experience more of the subtle horror that surrounds our (naive) main character. Yes, there are parts of this graphic novel that I find hard to understand, but thanks to expositions and the Alan Moore trademark afternotes, Providence has slowly found a way to creep into my veins and thought. \n For maximum delight and complete experience especially in the last chapter, I advise that you read Alan Moore's The Courtyard and Neonomicon first, then Providence. These titles are definitely a good addition to your bookshelf. \n Jacen Burrows deserves a round of applause too. His artistic knack for use of subdued colors, wild abstractions and shiny gore makes Burrows a perfect partner of Moore in this genre of horror. I hope this guy draws stories of other stellar writers like Jason Aaron, Scott Snyder and Rick Remender. \n Providence is a must-read for Alan Moore fans or H.P. Lovecraft aficionados. This guy may have its ups and downs in the world of graphic literature, but this certainly is one of his many home runs.",

        "text": "I could have sworn after the first few pages of this issue that the art is drawn by Greg Capullo. But it is in fact Viktor Bogdanovic's hand who made Action Comics #987 alive. The Oz Effect Part One treads on the familiar Superman trope as an ideal hero who saves the day then goes back to his Clark Kent disguise just in time to do his usual (dad) work. I don't complain. This is the Superman I want to read, full of hope and optimism and always ready to help those who are in need. \n Everything felt so Greg Capullo at the start. This guy Viktor Bogdanovic deserves some praise here. \n But does the human race deserve the Man of Steel? The Oz Effect revolves around this central theme that we, on our bare, primal instincts are inherently greedy and evil. The enigmatic character Oz goes full WW-Ares just to prove this point. And for all the crazy things that happened in this issue, he really presents a strong case. We really don't deserve Superman. \n Honestly, this \"villain thinks he's the hero\" and \"humans don't deserve us\" thing is something we have seen so many times already. The execution of the story, on the other hand is brilliant. Geoff Johns has been building this DC Rebirth era slowly and surely. The whole reveal at the end is just the cherry on top of this meticulously baked cake. \n Dan Jurgens is the perfect writer for this. It rings with sincerity among other genuine emotions. This issue felt like reading a 1980s-1990s Superman at the same time showing the readers some inconvenient truths happening in this world. That certain balance of emotions, plus the amazing reveal at the end (and don't forget the lenticular cover) makes Action Comics #987 a highly-recommended read.",

Since Boros the team continued to exapand Saitama's world beyond just monsters and heroes.

        "text": "You can sell a really bad idea and turn it into a genuine and sincere literary material. Secret Empire forced a really bad idea in a really bad story. Captain America being Hydra is something you can move on with if it is justified by a well-written story and good dialogue. But unfortunately Nick Spencer's Marvel crossover event fails big time. \n What I really dislike the most about Secret Empire is how it relies heavily on the much more successful MCU. Literally all characters from the movies and TV series are haphazardly packed into the storyline. You got the Inhumans, the Defenders, Doctor Strange, Black Panther the Guardians all doing their part in the story. But where are the Fantastic Four and the X-Men? Nada (Well, there are some of them just to say that they still exist in the Marvel comics world). The problem is, you do not need all of them to progress the story. Remove most of these characters and what remains is a generic and simplistic story about collecting fragments of the Cosmic Cube to rewrite history . \n DC Rebirth was a bad idea too. It was in its core a reboot, despite what Geoff Johns said that it is not. But people received it well. Why? Because the story is good. That's it. There's no forced diversity, and political drama (again, I have nothing against politics and diversity). The story is just good. Give us a good story and we will chew whatever you give us. \n But Secret Empire is so bad for me that I do not actually hate those who liked this. I envy you guys for getting the best out of it. I tried. Really tried. There are some genuinely good moments in SE though, but there are overwhelmingly bad pages in it that it drags everything down in my heart. Well, perhaps aside from its over-reliance in the MCU (and tie-up issues too!) and a poorly written story, some of of my feelings might also be attributed to event fatigue. Age of Ultron and Civil War II were awful. But SE could have been Marvel Comics' redemption and hope. \n A collective sigh signifies relief that Secret Empire is finally finished (hmmm how about SE Omega#1?) So Marvel, please focus on writing a good Legacy, okay? Please.",

        "text": "As part of my 2017 rereading list, The Multiversity by Grant Morrison is an ambitious project that is really worth a second read. With the recent events in DC's Rebirth era, this book becomes an even more relevant (yet still an unnecessary) read for DC comics fans. \n The Multiversity is a series of mostly one-shots whose stories can stand alone, almost independent tales from different worlds covered by an overarching plot that some evil called the Gentry (and ultimately, the Empty Hand ) has been causing chaos throughout the Multiverse. Such event with an extremely big scope can be handled by only a few writers, like Morrison himself. Despite having tendencies for the philosophy and dialogue drowning with \"Morrison-isms\", I personally feel that The Multiversity is one of his most reader-friendly creations. \n The stories in this book vary from the political Pax Americana to the golden age feels of Thunderworld advntures. What is really, really good with this series is that it has a wide spectrum of comic book story archetypes and sometime along the way, a reader would most definitely like at least one of these stories. The Multiversity goes beyond telling stuff from different universes, but also genuinely captures each of the universe's tone and emotion. \n That is the Endless Destiny at the top. \n My least favorite issue is the one that supposedly tells about how our on universe is invaded by this evil world. The 4th wall breaks in this issue were really forced and annoyingly abundant, whereas they were more subtle and natural (sometimes creepy) in the other issues. I also did not like the last issue. It was very underwhelming and not worth the buildup. The last issue made the whole Multiversity series more of a teaser. \n And that is in fact true. The Multiversity has been referenced in both explicit (see DC Metal #1) and unverified theories in DC Rebirth. So if you are interested in reading this, I ask that you read it with an open mind. This book has some genuinely creepy and happy moments that you will either savor or hate.",

The gore may be too much. But there are numerous titles which are much weirder and gorier than this.

That masked person who pursues Han and Leia is someone to look forward to, and I am interested on how this person will influence the whole Star Wars canon. Their POV feels genuinely like Vaughan's Saga. \n Meanwhile, the Luke vs. Fett fight is a lovely dose of action. Note that this is an amateur Luke fighting a veteran bounty hunter, so expect some crude light saber stuff in the pages. \n Vader's scene in this issue was also seen in a Darth Vader issue too, but the latter handles it better artwise. \n Overall, issue six is the best yet issue in Star Wars and I look forward to see what the series will deliver in the future.",

To think that I haven't given up hope with this until the last issue, but everything went down spectaculary bland, generic and uninspired. Secret Empire is a huge shame to Marvel Comics. \n Secret Empire relies heavily on the MCU and diversity thing that it epic fails on one element the readers are really seeking for: a good story. Like in my past reviews, I always say that a bad idea can always be well-received with a good story. Secret Empire presses a bad idea with the least favorable story, resulting to a money-milking crap scheme that will further contribute damage to the already injured Marvel publishing. It is just sad to see how the publishing company bas been completely ignored in favor of the much more successful MCU. \n Reading issue ten is an absolute borefest, executing one cliche after another in the most unexciting narrative that could be possibly written. You'd really feel that the creative team just wanted this event to end.",

        "text": "Now THIS is how you start an epic event. Scott Snyder teams up again with Greg Capullo (rock on!) and the old N52 Batman gang to deliver this Bat-centric event that may not just span throughout DC's rich history but also across the publisher's other imprints too. Dark Nights: Metal #1 is a solid triumph of deep, well-researched storytelling and fast-paced heavy metal action. \n Here's Snyder at his best. This guy never settles for the mediocre. In this issue, Snyder has seamlessly incorporated his trademark \"nice to know trivia\" narration and horror elements to craft a unique crossover series. Whereas Geoff Johns has a vision of grandiosity and epicness, Snyder's style is more grounded and brutal. \n There's no other perfect artist right now who can accurately put into illustration Snyder's vision than Greg Capullo. This guy is a beast. Each page of Metal #1 is a visual spectacle. The art in this issue demands a second and third look. It's just that great. \n This midnight release cover is just f*cking cool. \n To give a peek about what this event is, it's a fine mash-up of three things: 1. Batman's POV about his search for the Nth metal, 2. Hawkman's storyline that is also about that metal, and at the same time our guide in DC's history, and 3. the existence of a vast Dark Multiverse. It's a meta-story, a celebration of history, satisfying action and literally new worlds for DC. That is how vast Dark Nights: Metal is covering.",

Take Batman's Death of the Family as an example. Snyder's main stories are the ones necessary to understand and appreciate the whole story. The other tie-in issues, although they are fun to read are totally optional and it doesn't take anything away from the story. With Secret Empire, it is the other way around.",

        "text": "With Preacher's Garth Ennis and Neonomicon/Providence's Jacen Burrows. Crossed is definitely a good read, right? \n Wrong. \n This is from a reader who gets a certain guilty pleasure with gore and death. Volume one of Crossed crosses that moral line many times but didn't get to the satisfaction I wanted from reading such material. If gore and violence upsets you then Crossed is definitely a no-no in your read list. It displays a certain imagery that will definitely twist your mind and soul (so thanks, Jacen Burrows?). \n Going back, the thing that I do not want about Crossed is the story. The first volume is really an \"in the moment\" type of story. If done correctly, sacrificing character development and plot in favor of emphasizing the events currently drawn in the panels will effectively convey to the readers the feeling of actually experiencing those events themselves, be it the hopelessness and despair, or the glimmer of hope that sparks out of small talks. But Crossed vol. 1 doesn't really go know it's own direction; Is it a dumb gorefest or band of people on a mission? This perhaps is the reason why I'm not satisfied with the book. \n This is not the Garth Ennis I have expected. His Preacher was phenomenal. Crossed is just meh. Perhaps the other volumes will shed some more light about this world.",

Despite the company's cinematic success, it seems that they have lost touch with what made them, comics. \n You can give me a thousand reasons why this Secret Empire is great, but for me, Secret Empire is a big failure. It goes beyond the hate that Cap is now Hydra, it is the writing, man. It is all over the places. Issue number six I thought has solid and consistent writing and I hoped back then that the series is starting to gear it all up, but issue seven brought it back down. \n It is just good in good writing that you can sell a bad idea. DC Rebirth could have been a disaster, a total disaster, but readers bought the idea because the writing was so great. With Secret Empire, it is a bad mess of politics, science, forced \"hope\" narrations, magic, cinematic universe dependence, superhero antics and my god, cliches. Again, cliches are good if delivered effectively. \n I wonder how can Legacy turn the tide against the mixed reactions towards Secret Empire.",

It relies on a universally known fact that everybody knows who the hell are the main players of this epic space saga. Issue one is a fitting start. It gives you right away who the main players are and what they will be doing (which is either rebel or defend the galactic empire). The story happens right after the Death Star exploded. \n This issue doesn't have space battles. That would certainly come after. Like Episode IV, issue one started with good old corridor fights. So expect to see a lot of blasts and covers. \n Unlike Rogue One, even the comics has this line, the logo and the text crawl. It is so authentic that you'd here the SW opening fanfare in your soul. \n The last page of this issue is awesome, though it would certainly raise some nerdy eyebrows: Vader meeting Luke Skywalker definitely lessens the impact of their fight scene in episode V, so I'm interested how it will play out in issue two .",

Despite many bumps along the way, the creative team managed to deliver a fitting end. \n This issue is consistent with the movies. It perfectly displays our thinking on how Vader would react on certain events (and that scene with Aphra, Vader wouldn't be plain dumb for him to do that, it certainly has some emotional weight in it), how Palpatine would react, and what Aphra would do. Oh yes, Aphra. Seeing her on the big screen is all I ever wanted now. \n The end doesn't connect concretely as how the whole series starts after Episode IV. But I am happy to say that it seamlessly ties with Episode V, though the rope is still long. (i.e., it doesn't end where Episode V starts, but the connection is there) \n This issue is quite long, I would have been happier if it is in prestige format. Holding a thick comic this important needs extra careful hands. \n Overall, I was really afraid that the Darth Vader series ends rather bad but they have proven otherwise.

The Sith Lord is trapped in Vrogas Vas in search for Luke Skywalker. Unexpectedly, this is also a remote rebel base, so the resistance is huge, yet helpless against Vader. Doctor Aphra is also on a mission to rescue his Sith Boss and capture Luke as a token of trust. \n This is my first time reading the main Star Wars comics (skipped 1 - 12 for later), and like in the Darth Vader series, I am very impressed with the art. It is detailed, consistently good and accurate. When there are explosions, you will see glorious explosions. Colors and shadows are everywhere. \n A somewhat spoiler photo: \n Checkmate, Artoo. \n The ones who stole the show here are Han Solo, Artoo and Chewie.

        "text": "If there is one word that describes Metal's prelude Dark Days, it would be \"recognition\". Both The Forge and The Casting does not revamp a universe by throwing expendable elements into the bin and starting with a clean slate like what most Crises in DC, but instead lets the readers know that all of them have existed. These two issues act as a foyer of a new DC structure - the doors are opened for its readers enter in DC Universe Rebirth, now we are introduced to the vastness of this world as we gaze upon the different things and characters this comics giant has to offer. \n Duke finally gets a name in this issue, and no it's not bat or bird related. \n But reintroducing these concepts and characters, together with telling an effective story is nothing but a tall order for the creative team. Thankfully, DC Metal is helmed by Scott Snyder. This man here is a master of storytelling and effective, well-researched exposition (just read his New 52 Batman run). The resulting prelude issues, though many elements may cause confusion to us readers lay a solid foundation on what DC has to offer. \n Spoilers follow: \n Dark Days and the upcoming DC Metal I suppose would explain why the DC Universe has their own version of mutants and mutates. Perhaps explaining why Basil Karlo acquired the power and became Clayface and did not die, why Joker swam in a toxic chemical vat and did not die, why Barry Allen was doused in chemicals, struck by lightning and did not die, why Swamp Thing and Animal Man became champions of The Green and Red respectively. All because they have this Nth Metal in their blood. This has been introduced in this issue thanks to Joker's exposition and little experiment with Duke. Remember the test he was mentioned only has four flags: M-E-T-A, it strongly suggested that it is supposed to be M-E-T-A-L. This Nth Metal also gives powers to weapons. Like the Sunblade and that Shazam dagger. \n What we don't know is the extent of influence of the metal, although it is suggested that it is something big for it to get the attention of the Guardians of the Universe. Also, do Bruce Wayne and Oliver Queen also have Nth Metal in their blood? Is Hal Jordan and the other Lanterns chosen not only because of their willpower but also because they have this element inside them? \n These evil Batmen is a trademark Scott Snyder technique. It's like the Court of Owls but bigger and deeper. I'm excited to see what is their connection with the Nth Metal and the Dionesium (and is Nth Metal the Dionesium?) \n There are other elements that I don't understand in the story. The thing is, Snyder and the team reintroduces these elements, recognizing the fact that the DC Universe Rebirth era does not erase these things in their timeline.",

The writing is solid and not cluttered like before, despite the sheer number of characters and it has a well-balanced amount of story, emotion and action. It still has things that I really don't like but overall, if Nick Spencer goes to this route, Secret Empire may be on its way to redemption. \n Although I have seen the \"apologetic tone\" strategy with DC Universe Rebirth, that is utilized here effectively, and I am certain that many would relate with Tony Stark saying sorry to Cap, among other heartfelt words he said to him. That is some effective writing there. The action scenes where also worth seeing. There were definitely less words in them and more destruction and chaos. It has a genuine cinematic appeal that you seldom see in comics. \n Spoiler photo: Hell yeah. \n If Secret Empire improves further, making this issue as its launch pad, then those who have given up with this series should reconsider picking it up again.

Megan hates her mother and Donnie (whose plot is still hanging, except for the fact that we knew that he raped her). I personally personally want to keep plot points resolved first than introducing new characters. \n 5. The pentagram mark is still there. Still nothing special.

        "text": "Most of the works of Alan Moore are exemplary in the graphic literature world, and Providence just keeps on crawling up to be his most elegant written and well-researched comics. Providence, I admit has been a psychological mindf*ck for me as the story keeps on giving you more and more surprises as each chapter gets creepier. A horror material in its core, Providence does not rely on cheap jump scares (well these are panel surprises lurking at the next page) but instead Act 2 makes the reader go with Robert Black as he uncovers the mystery of the occult and subterranean denizens of the dreaming world. \n Jacen Burrows' art is as usual outstanding, as the visual tone really complements the story. The subdued and \"quiet\" actions of his art and great framing makes the book even more enticing to read. I find Providence best to be read very slow. With English not my native language, I find this extra time in understanding the dialogues enjoyable as I also appreciate the art. \n The uhm, dreamworld. You can put it that way. \n For someone who has little knowledge with H.P. Lovecraft themes, Providence is still a very good literary piece to experience. Just don't expect fast-paced, gory and gruesome horror (oh you'll find Moore and Burrows' other work, Neonomicon very engaging). Providence is a slow-burning delight you have to relish bite per bite.",

        "text": "If you ever got a chance to read New 52's Batman and Robin #18 written by Tomasi, read it. That is a silent masterpiece, a requiem and an aftermath of an event that broke (not the Bane-broke one) the Bat. Now, Batman issue 24 of DC Rebirth era does not have the same beats as Batman and Robin #18, but it is also a masterpiece. It is a careful study of what it is like as the Batman. \n This issue doesn't have a villain. Everything is peaceful in Gotham. That makes Batman 24 very special. It is also beautifully drawn, thanks to Danny Miki and David Finch. One thing that I felt with this issue is that it is very fresh and original, despite the fact that I've been reading Batman comics for almost a decade now. \n The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger, but IF Selina says \"yes\" , then the Batman comics landscape will change for the better. And I do solemnly hope that DC goes with this hopeful and definitely happier route.",

I'm now pumped to experience this DC event! \n Dark Days: The Forge comes with a beautiful foil cover (90s coming back?) drawn by Jim Lee. \n With all the issues solicited for the Dark Days (which is a prelude to DC Metal), clearly it is a Bat-centric story.

The story on the other hand has a lot of holes and at times felt convenient and forced, like why do every main character has to be connected with Bonnie in some ways? I got to overcome such gripes though. So overall, Reborn is a nice read and definitely a good one especially when you have nothing to do. \n This issue is all about the big showdown between Bonnie and Lord Golgotha. So here's one question that bugs me: why do bad people become to look like monsters and demons while good people retain all their human features? Anyway, the battle is sick and savage, all thanks to Capullo's art. I praised art again eh? Yes, because Reborn's beauty does not really rely on its story (which by the way has so much potential but book one turns out to be a missed opportunity), but on all these illustrations of the Reborn fantasy world. \n That's bloody savage.",

        "text": "*SIGH* \n Although the family dinner with Ultron was a welcome break to this convoluted piece of Marvel event, issue number four can be summarized in this way: Team Iron Man - 1, Team Hydra Cap - 1. The best thing with Secret Empire are the covers. And issue number four is no exception. Unfortunately, the story inside does not keep up with those sick covers. \n A nice change with issue four is that it focuses only on the main events, the cosmic cube fragments and that other Steve Rogers (who conveniently stumbled upon superpowered blokes so that his side of story can proceed). \n Secret Empire trusts that its readers are well aware of the past events in the whole Marvel universe. I am guilty of being ignorant of these events (except for cross-over titles) as I am a DC reader. So it was really hard for me to grasp many elements in the dialogues in the issue. So with this regard, the two-star rating is also my \"fault\" of not bothering to read other tie-ins and relevant arcs. \n In the end issue number four is a tad improvement from the previous three (no four) issues of Secret Empire. I still have my hopes high with this event though, so it is pretty early to judge it this early.",

This second issue further explores the mystery and intrigue that shrouds the chain of killings that happened in Gotham, and the root of it all may is in fact more sinister than what Batman could have imagined. \n I like the way the authors have written this mini crossover series. Readers who are unfamiliar with The Shadow (like me) could just easily jump in and read right away, although those who are familiar with The Shadow may find an extra bit of entertainment and references from the exposition scenes. \n Except for the overly long Bat-legs, I found no issue with Rossmo's art.

The Master Race is nowhere near the top tier of Batman comics like The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke, but it sure is a (forgettable) spectacle of several DC heroes in the Dark Knight universe. \n There are issues in DKIII that I abhorred and there are also these parts that gave me that feeling of sweet revenge. It felt short yet I don't want it to run any longer. It is totally skippable, unless you consider a Dark Knight label a necessary read. \n For those who are expecting a Bat-centric story, you will kinda get it here, I think. But the focus is not consistently framed on Bruce Wayne, but on Superman, Wonder Woman, Carrie Kelly and on those annoying one-dimensional evil Kandorians too. I won't blame you for hating this because this is not really a Batman story but rather a DC story happening in the DK world. I hate that idea too because this is, after all a Batman comics. Yet if you get over this, DKIII is really an enjoyable read, albeit a forgettable one. \n In the end DKIII is a missed opportunity for becoming a memorable Batman story. It has all the potential of being one. The legacy it imparts to its readers in the last issue is more of a set up for a possible DKIV but it is not enough to redeem the whole series.",

Tomasi and Gleason have effectively written a story that clearly reflects and explains this, as we watch through the eyea of Jonathan Kent. \n Like the first issue, Superman issue two is still subdued and calm, making sure steps that the readers would first like the characters. Sure there are superpowers like super strength and heat vision, bu the writers made sure that the personalities shine first. I particularly like the father-son interplay between Jonathan and Clark, as the latter is both protective yet aware that sometime in the future, his son will takeover his place, or at least be an effective superhero. \n It is in the details, like this Jonathan tongue-out anticipation and excitement pose that give the characters life and charm. \n This Rebirth Superman is the one we have missed during the New52 and I am happy he's back.",

And I am glad to say Superman is inspiring again. \n Superman is great again. \n Spoilers follow: \n Okay so the New52 Supes is now dead and the true Superman (the one who was killed in Doomsday, the golden age Supes, is alive and actually existed in the New 52 world. He is married to Lois Lane and they have a son named Kent. I feel that this family angle is a rather effective and heartfelt one.

Perhaps it is me since I don't read the tie-in comics, that is why I find the whole event flat, or Secret Empire is simply a failure. A lot, I mean a lot is happening here. So instead of the main issue dictating the pace and what happens in the tie-ins, it just feels like something that glues all of them rather than telling a cohesive story. \n The story is all over the place too.

It has revealed maybe too little to the reader's tastes, I agree with that. But great things has to wait. I love how DC Rebirth is being handled right now, dropping related issues from here and there, taking its time to grow instead of the usual 10-story series that weirdly starts with issue #0 (ahem, Secret Empire, ahem). \n At this time it is known to everybody that Dr. Manhattan has his hands to whatever is happening and whatever has happened to the DC Universe since the events of Flashpoint. Now we are yet to see other Watchmen characters' involvement in here. Is it just the Big Blue Jon Osterman or are we going to see other Watchmen? I hope that it is the latter. I mean, seeing Rorschach on the roofs Gotham City buildings, brooding over the crime and sin below is 100% sick! \n Jay Garrick's brief appearance in this issue gives a strong statement: the DC Universe is on its way to another Golden Age, an age full of optimism and goodness. \n Going back, this issue also pays homage to the original Watchmen series, implementing that 9-panel page Watchmen is famous for.

        "text": "Book Three offers a satisfying yet sad conclusion to Snyder and Lemire's three-part After Death mini-series. The last page was pure evil and brilliance, something like leaving a fragrant turd in your brain. \n For those who are just planning to read A.D. After Death, I just want to tell that this is not for everybody. This is definitely not for me as I expected a story which is straightforward sci-fi, but what I got (I should have known in the first place, when the name Jeff Lemire is printed in the cover) are themes of existential dread, yearning for love, transcending loneliness and death. My reading experience therefore was a bit rugged at the start while assimilating myself with these themes. But once you get on with it, A.D. sure gives you one helluva experience. \n SPOILERS FOLLOW. \n A dumb, shallow and overly simplistic way to tell what A.D. is all about is to just say that there is this one crazy dude who plans to escape utopia over and over. I'm sure everybody else in the place are just chill with living forever, but no sir, not Mr. Cooke. \n A deeper meaning of this would go somewhere in being free and being courageous and not anymore running away from whatever FUBAR situation a person experiences. Snyder's prose effectively delivers this message of chilling sadness and loneliness. \n The prose part gets a bit long for my taste, and at times I felt like reading a novel instead of reading a graphic novel. Yet I understand that part, that for someone who has overcome death, he has all the time in the world to write volumes of journals. \n A.D. After Death deserves to be seen in the big screen and I sincerely hope that that plan comes into fruition. This is a sad sci-fi story that everybody deserves to see, despite the fact that the story itself is a little alienating to others.",

        "text": "SPOILERS FOLLOW. \n If you are reading this review, I want you to go back at the last three pages of Secret Empire #2. In my opinion, these last three pages strongly feels like they've just been added at the last minute. The page right before that (the bar scene) abruptly ended, and these three pages just look different. Feels like the editors hastily advised Spencer to reveal this other Steve Rogers to give its readers hope. I hate it. Secret Empire is too generic and highly predictable. \n Marvel is making us buy comics for a series that is unnecessary had the concept of Captain America being a Hydra spy hasn't been conceived in the first place. It felt that the are making money for the grave mistake that they have created. At least DC on the other side of the fence is worth reading.",

It is too obvious to deny that the general beats in this issue feels like a Star Wars story on Earth. \n Now that Marvel is pleading to its readers to wait until the series ends, well okay, give us a great story then.",

        "text": "Secret Empire #0 does not feel like reading issue 0. It IS in fact an issue one, a necessary read in a mini-series. So this numbering scheme is more on style over meaning. \n Nothing is substantially wrong with Secret Empire from the story and art point of view. It is an enjoyable, easy read (note that I only read huge Marvel crossovers, as opposed to having a constant pull list with DC comics issues) even for someone like me who knows one thing: Captain America is Hydra. \n That is the fundamental flow in this whole overarching thing. Making someone evil because some cosmic cube alters reality does not give Steve Rogers the much needed anchor so that readers can sympathize with Cap's new ideology. Barry Allen has this \"save mother\" angle in Flashpoint. Superman has a totally sell-able reason on why he became a douche tyrant in Injustice. Here, Captain America was helpless and conveniently transformed into a Hydra sleeper agent \"just because\". \n Secret Empire also heavily relies on their much more successful cinematic universe. That is a plus up to some extent since I really do not have to delve into reading comics just to know who these characters are. At the same time, it is also severely undermining the established X-Men who are almost absent in the whole Marvel comics world and replacing mutants with the concept of Inhumans, which is kind of a dick move. \n I'd still read Secret Empire for the sake of knowing what happens. At least this series got my interest.",

        "text": "If you love that Jeff Lemire trademark formula of loneliness and hopeless yearning induced by separation of worlds, mixed with a healthy dose of weird family/lover drama, you will definitely love Black Hammer. And its first volume is a slow-paced and carefully written introduction to a team of superheroes who somehow are \"imprisoned\" in a country town in what might be another universe. Secret Origins focuses on the what and the who about the characters, while deliberately postponing the answers to the why and the how they got into that place. \n Black Hammer's strength therefore comes from the distinct personalities of the characters and the interesting interplay between them. \n Each main character in Black Hammer gets his/her own issue, carefully fleshing out their personalities and their motivations. Like why Golden Gail abhors being inside the body of a nine-year old girl, or why Colonel Weird is well, weird. Embedded in each issue are their respective past lives as celebrated superheroes, decade-old memories of their JLA/Avenger-ish exploits. I like how Lemire imagines them as golden-age comics superheroes who can be facetiously labeled as ripoffs from characters we are very familiar with. For example, Golden Gail is Dark Horse's Mary Marvel, or Abe Slam is Captain America. Even one of the villains look like a mashup of Galactus, Darkseid and the Anti-Monitor! \n Little has been told about the mystery that engulfs our team of marooned superheroes, why they got there and what happened right before. Yet the character-driven volume one efficiently takes its readers to the world of these sad superheroes.",

        "text": "After what has been revealed in Flash #21, I have very high expectations with Batman #22 (part three of this 4-issue special, The Button). Maybe that is the reason why this issue only got four stars from me. Still, this is one helluva beautiful issue. \n SPOILER WARNING. As a fast review, I'll just say that this four-issue The Button special is a must buy for those who are following DC's Rebirth story superarc. \n Batman #22 is Flashpoint-heavy, so there's a bit of exposition for the readers to catch up with this alternate world Batman and Flash has visited. That is perfectly fine for those who have not read or have forgotten what the Flashpoint story was. I expected something more. There are also some pages which are dedicated to them fighting Amazonians and Atlanteans which I know are only there for this issue to have some fight scenes. What this issue severely lacked is a hearty conversation between Bruce and Thomas Wayne. That would be very, very unforgettable in the Batman canon - meeting his dad and having a quiet father to son, son to father conversation. That would definitely give Bruce Wayne an overwhelming sense of renewed vitality or something like that. Other than that, this issue shines. I just hope that this four-issue special ends in a fantastic way.",

        "text": "The Flash #21 continues The Button storyline which started with Batman #21. For those who are interested what is happening here, Batman and Flash are trying to uncover the mystery behind the button which appeared in the Batcave (see DC Universe: Rebirth #1) which readers would recognize as The Comedian's pin from Alan Moore's Watchmen. The story so far takes us (slowly but surely) to the person or persons who \"stole ten years away\" from the DC characters, hence hurting them and making them weak. The Flash #21 is also tied to the events of Flashpoint, the event that ultimately gave birth to DC's New52 era. So I highly recommend that you read these three books first: DC Universe Rebirth, Watchmen and Flashpoint, and perhaps Before Watchmen: Dr. Manhattan as an optional one to fully appreciate what is going on with The Button special. \n SPOILER-HEAVY review incoming. As a fast review, I just want to say that you have to buy and read this. BUY AND READ. You will be very much entertained. \n I am really into this Rebirth thing DC's has, so I am so happy that so far, they have handled it pretty well, exceeding my expectations as a matter of fact. This issue treads on familiar Flash grounds, his origin story, his love for forensics, the Reverse Flash, the Mercury helmet which we all know belongs to Jay Garrick (JSA! JSA!) and the Cosmic Treadmill! Yes, the Cosmic f*ckin' treadmill. This paved the way for Batman and Superman to do some time-space-alternate reality travel, and boom Bruce Wayne met his father Thomas Wayne in the Flashpoint reality. I mean man, that last page reveal was absolutely perfect.",

Although we all know about Batman, most of us (that includes me of course) have never heard of The Shadow until this mini-series came up. \n I never knew The Shadow until reading the first issue of this crossover comics. \n Issue number one may not have those beginnings that yo can call memorable or fantastic, but it is certainly entertaining. Here we experience The Shadow's soft introduction, given that he is relatively unknown to many. It doesn't give him an extensive backstory though, and that is something I like since backstories tend to give wordy dialogues and heave exposition. Instead, this crossover feels more organic, like The Shadows in Gotham City is like having another mystery villain/hero that Bruce Wayne has to solve.",

        "text": "Why do we love Saga this much? \n This question can absolutely never be answered with shitty answers like \"the art's damn beautiful\" or \"the story is great\". Sure those are the attributes of this graphic literature by Brian Vaughan and Fiona Staples, but you cannot give justice and won't be able to fully describe how good Saga is with those one-line descriptions. That is how f*ckin great this series is. So if you haven't read it, my god, can you just buy and read it? \n Volume seven embodies all I love about this comic. There's so many that I might not be able to tell them all, or not in a systematic sort of way, but let me start with saying something that most of us would agree on: Saga's characters are just perfect. Perfect in a way that their imperfections and all that constitute their persona are the ones that drive the story to greatness. A good story cannot be fully realized or appreciated without awesome characters. Characters who are human, both brave and cowards, flawed yet they try to be who they aspire to be. Marko, Alana and the group aspires to be a family (with a tranny horn, a ghoul and a droid) despite their differences. The Will dreams (literally) of his past so that he can think about his future. Gwen aspires to make the galaxy to be a bit better places despite the horror of her actions. \n Their voices may ring of happiness and quips, but ultimately, you'd feel a tone of loneliness, almost lost in the vastness of space. \n All these characters have voices, and if you hear them in the wonderfully constructed words in the bubbles, you'd hear them so loud yet so distant in the vastness of space. Their voices may ring of happiness and quips, but ultimately, you'd feel a tone of loneliness. F*ck, even L.C. has feelings! \n Brian Vaughan lashes out his own political views about themes like war, spiritualism and the blind following to religion, the savagery and self-righteousness of those who are in power, terrorism and sexuality. I didn't buy those things in his Ex Machina but I did here in Saga. Again it is in the characters, in their point of view and in those little conversations that those views become very personal and very endearing, and before realize it, these themes are already inside your system. \n Fiona Staples has never been this good. Her illustrations have a perfect mix of ruggedness and love that it gives Saga its visual tone. I mean, that issue #37 cover alone is perfection perfected. I love the nuances in the emotions of the faces she draws. The sense of wonderment in these pages has been effectively conveyed by the illustrations. \n The only (very minuscule) disappointment I have with this volume is that I was expecting to see a bit of skirmishes, since after all this arc is The War for Phang. To those of you who haven't read this book, don't expect a battlefield. Nonetheless you will be thoroughly entertained as I did. Even cried a little at the end. Oh yeah, this is really not spoiler because it is a common thing in Saga, but yeah, something happens. Haha, damn you Brian K. Vaughan! Thank you too.",

        "text": "Batman #21 is a delight to read in so many levels. I am absolutely entertained reading this issue, in fact the second best that I have read in DCs Rebirth era (next to Geoff Johns' DC Universe Rebirth). So before I go to my spoiler-filled review, let me just say again that this is a must-buy for everybody who loves comics. \n To fully enjoy this issue and the whole DC Rebirth thing, it is imperative that you have already read Watchmen (and perhaps Before Watchmen's Dr. Manhattan) and Flashpoint because there are many elements that give reference to those two materials. Tom King's 9-panel layout is a nod to Alan Moore's work, melding symmetry and parallelism in each beautifully drawn box. And DC gave the honor of drawing the pages of issue #21 to Jason Fabok, a dude who is so familiar with Batman (Batman Eternal, Detective Comics). \n Batman issue 21 is the first of four parts. \n Although not much has been revealed to the readers, the little things that have happened in this issue, which by the way happened mostly in the cramped space of the Batcave are nothing less than awesome. Perhaps the most significant thing that we have learned is (again spoiler alert) that the Button can act as a channel which can tap into the speed force and eventually see this \"god\" thing. Even Reverse Flash didn't stand a chance against this god, or should I assume, Dr. Manhattan. So the Button's a sort of portal and that I believe is a key element in this Rebirth-Watchmen story. \n I also love the 24-esque style of narrative device to emphasize the concept of time for speedsters, where everything happens very fast. This and the overly amazing and bloody mano-a-mano fight between Reverse Flash and Batman is worth every cent you have paid for this issue. \n Batman issue 21 is the first of four parts. I don't complain if it scarcely revealed anything. If the DC Rebirth story is as good as this, then the writers and creative teams have all the time in the world.",

And oh yeah, if you want to see a montage of character designs, you ought to read this! \n Trinity #8 is an inconsequential Superman v Superman brawl that could have been averted with a simple conversation. \n The message is clear though: someone is out there to weaken our big boy blue, therefore weakening the whole roster of DC heroes, starting from the Trinity, the League and perhaps the Titans next. But again, in the end Trinity #8 is just a filler issue.",

Yet this work of Masamune Shirow is not another Akira. Though each of the chapters in this collection is a good read in its own right, Ghost in the Shell fails to deliver a cohesive over-arching narrative where everything is loosely bound together with a surprisingly generic amount of counter-terrorism action. \n But given some more time, one would definitely appreciate the many, many things GitS tries to conver to its readers, from the very shallow fan service quips in the illustrations to the quantum physics stuff about the mind, soul and ghosts. But viewed without these stuff, Ghost in the Shell follows Major Kusanagi and her band of merry cyborgs as cyber police who tackle problems like stopping possible terrorist strikes, assassination assignments, reconnaissance and other stuff you'd see in a decent police story. The chemistry between the characters are great and I have to commend Shirow for dealing with the main characters' personalities very consistently. \n Each chapter (save for the last one) starts with pages in color. \n The biggest gripe I have with this volume is its story. There are many times that the manga is very hard to follow, especially when Shirow throws all these political names and random scientific stuff out of nowhere. Rereading is a must here. There were also some dialogues which are either too much in exposition or too much in spritiual and scientific blabbering.",

There's that fight of course in the end but in a rather subdued and in an extremely small scale given what Mongul (and even Poison Ivy) can REALLY do. But Better Together is more of a character study of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman - who they really are at their core, what binds them and what distinguishes them from each other. \n Manapul's art is another thing. His color choices are vibrant and the color contrasts are just pleasing to look at. This may be the most dreamy-vibed main series in DC Rebirth right now. And I am pleased that Manapul has went to that route instead of a more generic superhero art gallery.",

The art alone is worth a peek and that \"one-shot\" lure would almost make this an instant pull in a comics shelf, but this Hardman creation is more of a missed opportunity than something which is ought to be read. \n The story begs to be explained and the details expanded. It's like watching one particular horror scene in Stranger Things (the woods scene with Nancy and Jonathan) but you totally don't know what is happening in the bigger picture. That seems to be a nice premise for a follow-up issue or even a whole series, but the problem is, I'm not that interested to pick this up. Partly because the horror genre today is over-saturated with vampires and people turning to monsters and partly because the dialogue is so disjointed it failed to reinforce the otherwise great art style. \n The imagery Gabriel Hardman delivers in The Belfry are genuinely horrific, but a disjointed dialogue and uninteresting characters fail to reinforce that otherwise convincing horror art. \n If the image above makes you interested in reading The Belfry, this is really worth a shot.

I mean, Brian Vaughan totally slayed it in Saga and for most parts of Y: The Last Man, so why can't I see through the goodness of Ex Machina? \n Maybe because I see the story of the series as two things which try to meld into one cohesive literary material - the political views and issues that engulf post-9/11 NY City, and the whole of America and Hundred's exploits as the Great Machine prior to his election as the Big Apple's mayor. Sometimes they work, like the brilliant storytelling in the ricin poison mini-arc, but sometimes they do not, like in that very underwhelming story about Pherson, a sound engineer turned villain who can talk to animals as Hundred can talk to machines. That flashback about Pherson was so vague and unnecessarily long, though it managed to reveal a little bit of information about this superhuman power of communication. \n The right mindset will definitely let you experience some level of entertainment reading it. \n Moreover, I also do not share many of Hundred's (and ultimately Brian Vaughan's) patriotic political views. Even sometimes, the story doesn't give a sh*t about balance of views and just throws in arab terrorism and white supremacy stuff, though in very minute doses. At least, journalist Spider Jerusalem of Transmetropolitan as much as possible presents the opposing views of warring ideas and \"sees\" beyond the surface to uncover what is really happening in the world of politics. \n But like I say, this low rating is more of an \"it's not you, it's me\" issue. Once you get the right mindset and dig the political viewpoints presented in the story there's no doubt that you'll experience some level of entertainment reading Ex Machina.",

It is about the story of Mitchell Hundred, NY's mayor and a man who mysteriously got the power to talk to machines, who for a time became The Big Apple's superhero. Volume number one is a good introduction to the protagonist yet it barely reveals what the series will about in its next installments. \n Ex Machina, as far as the first book is concerned is definitely not Vaughan's best work. While I loved his Y: The Last Man and absolutely relished reading Saga, Ex Machina narrowly kept my interest alive (thanks to a handful gory illustrations, haha). All the characters, especially Hundred is boring as hell. Character development gets buried as Vaughan works more in building up the politics, intrigue and the \"post-9/11 messiah depression disorder\". I just hope that all these are just part of a slow-burn writing style that will eventually reach a satisfying conclusion. \n By now it is safe to say that Brian Vaughan definitely loved Garth Ennis' Preacher. I am not saying that this is a complete rip-off, but Hundred's machine-speak ability has its uncanny similarities with Custer's Word of God, only this time with machines. (Going further, I also felt that Yorick Brown's interstate journey in Y: The Last Man certainly got its inspiration to Custer, Tulip and Cassidy's nomadic adventures while Marko and Alana's star-crossed love in Saga mirrors the forbidden love between the angel and the devil in Preacher.) \n Hundred's superhero alter-ego screams to be free again in this rather depressing city of post-9/11 New York. \n Speaking of Y: The Last Man and Saga, our man Mitchell Hundred definitely needs a strong woman (or gay) partner. Vaughan has the knack to create a inherently weak and jovial protagonist teamed up with a more pragmatic, stronger supporting partner. I definitely want to see that in Ex Machina.",

Think of the duel that happened in this volume as a mature version of the sick fight between Kenshin and Shishio. \n And yes, I am not even halfway reading Shigurui. For the sheer gore and guilty pleasure fun I have experienced reading it, I give this volume five stars.",

Five volumes in, the Shigurui proves to be violent, full of guts (literally) and death. \n The story arc is a typical revenge story, something that you have heard a million times before, but the way it was executed, the the story unfolds in an interesting manner, Shigurui deserves to be read by those who wanted some guilty pleasure fun and violence.",

        "text": "Seven to Eternity, thanks to Jerome Opena's undeniably great artwork also has the potential of being grand and beautiful. So I have very high hopes for Remender that he will utilize whatever stories the world of Zhal has into something worth reading and a comic series that is memorable and timeless. Pretty high expectations? Yes actually, because the first four issues of the series are consistently good. \n Again, Jerome Opena's work here is an absolute beauty. The way he delivers the action and war, there is some kind of color poetry that is happening. That Piper art is so sick! The story may be a forgivable \"man on a quest to save family\" thing which then things escalate very quickly, but god, the art is so good to look at that I frequently stop and postpone reading the speech bubbles just to admire the illustrations. Remender's words in this volume on the other hand need to be read for a few times before you can actually get what he is really trying to say. At times they are disjointed, something that slightly affected my reading experience. \n Jerome Opena draws one sick Piper bastard. \n Do yourself a favor and read Seven to Eternity. This series by Rick Remender is fantasy like no other.",

The first five issues of All-Star Batman really didn't sell for me because I just cannot stand John Romita Jr.'s art, not that I tried so hard. Tula Lotay did a stellar job in this Poison Ivy issue. \n I have seen Poison Ivy many times in comics, she's currently even in Manapul's Trinity series. And Ivy is always portrayed as a seductive plant user with a magical appeal. Here, Snyder touches on her side as a plant scientist, a respected botanist who has extensive knowledge about the flora. And Batman even recognizes the fact that she is best in this, even calling her Dr. Isley. \n Tula Lotay's art is something to praise in issue seven. Also in this page, we see a bit of character study of Poison Ivy. (Lisa Wood if you are reading this, I'm an instant fan!) \n The colors match Lotay's artwork, but sadly the letters are quite disconcerting. Yet overall, I had a blast reading All-Star Batman #7",

Nothing less can be expected from this veteran artist who has perfected his craft in his New 52 Batman run with the writer and his dear friend Scott Snyder. Reborn is always good to look at, whether you are looking at the lush green faerie forests of the good side, or the bloody rotten world filled with evil denizens. \n Unfortunately, the whole Reborn series has one fundamental flaw: Mark Millar has not until now established a convincing world. The whole world building aspect of Reborn struggles to keep up with the action. The story tries to reveal how this life after death works, who becomes good and evil, what is this place, and the list of expositions and rules just pop up. \n Moreover, there are also some aspects of the story that I find ridiculous, even for a high fantasy. A pet cat of the protagonist Bonnie who became a bad general in the afterlife, a robotic b*tch who was once Bonnie's classmate, a demon hellspawn who will make love with a giant lion. Things are randomly being made up. \n The plot is also way too convenient. Bonnie all of a sudden becomes a badass female John Wick because she \"remembers\". I got to mention as well that the wish thing near the end was dumb. It was drawn good, but still a very non-smart thing to write. \n The whole world building aspect of Reborn struggles to keep up with the action. \n Reborn is a runaway train that has lost track of its own story. It is a chaotic comic that even the beautiful artwork cannot save.",

        "text": "Since this is the last volume of Chew, let me give you my overall impression about the series, followed by a short review of volume 12. \n Chew and Brian Vaughan's Saga are the reasons why I started reading Image Comics titles. \n Chew, written by John Layman and drawn by Rob Guillory is a unique story about people having food-related superpowers, a mysterious space writing and a chronicle of events that centers in family and friendship - all drenched in edible barf, blood, fingers, ear lobes and whatever crazy rotten stuff Layman can throw to our epicurean taste buds. It is all original from start to finish. Guillory's cartoonish style of drawing perfectly complements the rowdiness and frenetic action Chew offers to its readers. \n This, together with Brian Vaughan's Saga are the reasons why I started reading Image Comics titles. The series has been consistently entertaining and violent in a way which is very palatable and delicious to my taste, even though much of it are really guilty pleasures. \n I highly recommend Chew to everybody. \n And as for the final volume, it didn't really meet my expectations, given that it had been set low from that very disappointing volume 11. The last volume felt very different from what Chew is all about: a fast-paced fun and non-depressing story. Yet volume 12 is a bit dragging at many times, all thanks to Savoy's pompous conversations and also quite depressing in its ending. \n The ending was also unexpected in a bad way. Note that there are surprises in stories which are genuinely good. Chew's ending is not. \n So even though I find the whole Chew series to be consistently fun and engaging, its last two volumes lack the spirit that Chew has and ended in a rather mediocre way. Still, congratulations to John Layman and Rob Guillory for the whole reading experience.",

That's a problem with ending a spectacular story arc with an awesome buildup towards the climax. The previous installment, Chew Volume 10 was so awesome John Layman couldn't follow it up with another one. It is, I believe the climax of the whole series. \n The problem of Last Suppers is that there is too much pompous Savoy monologue in it. I get it already. He speaks that way. So please, let us wrap this all up, can we? There's also this unnecessary sidetrip Savoy and Chu took and I don't know what they really did there except for revealing to us that chicken humanoids have existed in our world eons ago and they would have been the alpha hunters in the food chain if they weren't wiped out like the dinosaurs . \n Chew volume 11 is a significant downgrade to what the series has consistently been throughout all of its issues.

The story that gave birth to DC's shortlived New 52 era plays under the premise that someone mysteriously messed up the timeline. And you know? It works.

It is very, very easy to follow. \n DC's Flashpoint launched the New 52 era. \n I love how Geoff Johns manages to pull the strings in today's DC world, how he reconciles different story arcs and events into a huge cohesive DC mega-arc.

Why do they have to do these great deal of destruction and damage to the dry lands just to make a point?

The Mer could hallucinate their way through our hearts and let the humans find a way peacefully to that twist in the ending of this book. \n After a very solid part one, The Wake part two spirals into a convoluted mess of a story, reaching an inevitable action-packed climax and a twist, that though clever at best, severely lacked the confidence to deliver an astonishing end. Scott Snyder asked the readers for too much trust, but delivered an underwhelming and severely preachy finale. \n The biggest problem with The Wake I think is that it asks as to sympathize with these deep-sea creatures and for once just be open with what they are trying to say. But I cannot do this, not after killing millions and forced humanity to live in a post-apocalyptic world . This is the Jar Jar Binks effect: one cannot just like what is built up to be unlikeable in the first place. The other protagonists, The Arm also lacked the motivation to why they are preventing Leewards (the protagonist of part two) on her quest to seek the truth. They technically have nothing to lose if they just let go of her. \n I understand that The Wake tries to be philosophical and at times spiritual about humanity. The message never reached me. In fact I just wished that the story delves into a generic Mer vs. humans showdown ala-Independence Day. I would have been more entertained. \n That doesn't mean that The Wake is awful.

        "text": "The first comics I've read that was created by the Snyder/Murply tandem was one of the short stories in New 52's Detective Comics #27. I absolutely loved that part of the super-sized special. Back then, Scott Snyder was paired with Greg Capullo in their legendary Batman run. Sean Murphy on the other hand is already making waves of his own. Though I didn't actually like his Punk Rock Jesus, I thought that his art would really shine. \n Yep, you have that one in The Wake. \n Then there's The Wake. I am so elated that finally, we'll get to see a full-blown story written by Snyder and drawn by Murphy. And let me tell you, this team really works! I love the cinematic appeal this comics has. Set in a rig far below the depths of the ocean, the story follows marine biologist and cetologist (crudely defined as a whale scientist) Lee Archer and her crew in uncovering a mystery behind a creature the rig workers had found. The story starts with Arrival-ish (Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner) feels, with a crack team on a quest to solve a puzzle, then things turned out drastically different at the end. \n What I liked the least about The Wake is Snyder's tendency to over-lecture his readers about history and folklore. Although long-time readers of Snyder will definitely know that it is bound to happen somewhere in the story, The Wake is filled with exposition that there are times it felt really awkward for a certain character to be delivering a lesson given the circumstance they are in, you just don't give a fine lecture about myths and folklore when your life is on the line . \n The Wake part one feels so underwater that Aquaman could have popped-up outta nowhere and participated in whatever is happening in the story. I love it as it is and I wish to see it in the big screen someday.",

The sensuality of the last chapyers, although not as plenty as the previous ones, are definitely the most erotic the two protagonists has ever gone to. This is the ultimate blue balls manga, depriving Hideo Aiba of sex despite numerous extremely close encounters with Kurumi. \n I enjoyed reading Sundome for what it is, forgiving the sheer amount of ridiculous elements Sundome is stuffed with and just going where the story brings me.",

        "text": "I always hold a high regard for Mervin Malonzo's work ever since Tabi Po. His art work in Tabi Po, Ang Subersibo and now After Lambana are always high in quality, and IMHO one of the best contemporary local Filipino comic artists. His art can be best described as immersive, where readers are being brought in to the story itself, be it the Spanish era of Tabi Po and Ang Subersibo or the phosphorescent city nightlife in After Lambana. \n This is my first time reading a work written by Eliza Victoria. I'm really impressed how she seamlessly interspersed traditional folklore in the modern setting, sprinkling the world with diwata (fairies) dust, magic, and fairy wings. I just wished that there is more exposition about what has really happened between the diwata and the humans. The end part I think was a bit rushed (considering that the first two acts were perfectly paced) that I ended reading it with some thoughts in my mind left unexplained. Eliza Victoria definitely has to write a sequel! \n The clever use of color contrast makes After Lambana a unique visual treat. \n The story may not be After Lambana's strongest weapon, but just being there with Ignacio and Conrad as the truth unfolds is very satisfying. The tone of the story is definitely reminiscent of Murakami's After Dark, added with tiny bits of plot elements from Harry Potter, X-men and Gaiman's Sandman. \n After Lambana is a definite must-read by all those who are seeking for high-quality Filipino comics.",

Mixed with Lemire's watercolor based art and his trademark themes of loneliness and separation between lovers, After Death gives its readers a truly unique experience. \n This book is not for everybody. I myself took a great effort to read the prose part, itching to get back again at the comic sections. The fault is clearly on my part for not seeing the beauty in those words. \n Book two has so much backstory in it. This issue bridges many gaps that has been left by the previous one, explaining what happened \"before death\", where they are now and why the protagonist is dead serious about the listening mission. Many elements are still left untouched though, things which might be fully explained in the last volume. \n After Death asks the readers for its trust and confidence, like believe that there's something important in that cow (which for some weird reason annoys me too much). I just hope that the payoff will be satisfying in the last book.",

Katsuhiro Otomo has created a masterpiece that is teeming with pure non-stop action. Volume six didn't hit all the right spots in seamless storytelling, hugely because of the sheer amount of thins happening in the book. With so many players in the board, I am still amazed that the author still managed to pull off a spectacular finale. \n Akira. \n Reading each volume is like watching an entire movie. The whole series will not be given justice if it is compressed into one film, so thankfully the Akira anime film has huge deviations from the graphic material. Saying which is better between the book and movie is a tough choice to make. The movie, even though it has the same key plot points as the manga, by itself stands on its own. \n Overall, I really enjoyed reading this series, though I am not sold on some of the author's choices in the last volume, my whole reading experience has been a great, high-octane ride.",

These encounters become even more intimate along the way. \n Sundome now starts to creep its way to a really, really weird BDSM territory. Some of them are twisted and at the same time funny in an uncimfortable way. \n There's another angle Sundome is starting to show: Kurumi's past. The nose bleeds and her frequent absence in class hint that she may have a dark and mysterious past.",

        "text": "Sundome (s00n-do-meh) is an ecchi seinen manga that, aside from tons of panchira, hard-ons and breasts (pardon my language), is a school life story about a \"relationship\" between Hideo Aiba and Kurumi Sahana, both members of the Roman club, a group which has a penchant for knowing occult stuff. \n This is a blue balls manga. In its erotic scenes, Sundome raises the sexual intensity up until the point of, you know, \"release\". It plays on the readers' inherent interest to perversions and sexual fetishes without the actual coitus itself (at least for the first volume). It fills most of its pages with gratuitous sexual titillation without going all the way. So if you are not really into such things, then I advise you not to read Sundome. \n To be fair for it's slice-of-life aspect, Sundome volume one is actually funny. It really does have that shounen appeal. Yet almost every joke or situation is tagged with an explicitly perverted theme and offensive sexual objectification. \n If you are curious, then go and grab a copy of Sundome volume 1. Otherwise, let this be a fair warning on what you will see inside.",

What happened to Two-Face at the end was a bit underwhelming, yet deep inside my heart, the story could have delivered. But something is really wrong with the whole series. \n Oh I know what it is! It's Romita's art! Haha. \n On a more serious note, I also kept on trying to appreciate JRJR's art style, even trying to forget how great Capullo's art was in the New 52 Batman series. So the very fact that I struggled to appreciate his style, but to no avail is a clear sign that the Snyder-Romita Jr. tandem doesn't work at all. I'm sorry, but the way Romita drew the characters kept me from liking any one of them. \n Sorry Romita Jr. I tried to appreciate your art (really), but to no avail. \n Story-wise, Snyder really tries to deepen both Bruce and Dent's relationship told in under a theme duality and two heads, something which fits Two-Face's binary philosophy. We even get to see flashbacks of their friendship when they were just boys. Also true to its title, villains from different tiers in Batman's rogue's gallery show up in the series, even the likes of Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. \n All-Star Batman felt that it could have been better than it is now. The first five issues is a missed opportunity. Now that the next issue has a new artist, yeah, my only hope is for it to get better.",

        "text": "If you are reading this review, there might be a possibility that you may have watched the movie and probably thinking if it is just a condensed version of the manga. So I'll start my review with that. Bear in mind though that Akira has six volumes, thus I don't know the whole scope of the similarities and the differences. \n So, is the manga the same with the anime? Yes and no. The manga is way more extensive than the movie. Key plot points in the comics are also there in the movie so that the latter does not deviate that much from away the source material, but I feel that you are missing too many things in the film. There's a lot of interplay between the characters that you haven't seen in the movie, though the core elements are still there. Like Kaneda and Tetsuo are BFFs, Kei is a sort of love interest to Kaneda, you have the \"children\" and their look-out-for-each-other vibe. \n Bike bros. Kaneda and Tetsuo's relationship and actions towards each other are pivotal to the story. \n Book better than the movie? I can hardly say after reading just volume 1 of six. But I reckon that both have their own merits that make them a great on their own. But if a gun is pointed at my head and asks me to choose one, I'd say the movie. Like I said, it's an unfair judgment given this early.",

Not that I'm complaining though, Batman could have ended with the Endgame arc. Although Mr. Bloom is quite interesting and the end of his arc has the biggest boom the City of Gotham ever has, it pales compared with the other story arcs. \n An unnecessary volume. Batman could have ended with volume nine, but DC knows we have ten fingers, so there you have it. \n And then you get this, a completely unnecessary volume ten. Because DC has to make money and we don't have nine fingers. We have ten. The only worthwhile issue to read here is issue #51 which easily gets a five-star rating. Everything Snyder and Capullo has been giving us for five years has come to a full circle with this poignant sendoff issue. The other issues were just there merely to make this a \"collected edition\". It has Batman Future's End which you have probably bought way back before because of its lenticular cover, an Annual issue which is always a pain to read, a Batman Rebirth issue you have also bought before because it is a Rebirth special and a Batman issue 52, because the number 52 is DC's googoo gaagaa. \n In the end, people will still buy this book (like I did) only because it's hard to accept the fact that their shelves do not have this final New 52 Batman volume.",

        "text": "Just in case you have missed it, Viz Media released three compendiums of Junji Ito's works: Gyo, Uzumaki, and the newest one, Tomie. \n Viz Media's Tomie compiles Ito's 14-year work in this beautifully bound tome of horror. To give you a background about this episodic manga's main character, just remember these four things about her: \n 1. Tomie can seduce about any man she meets. These men will do anything just to get her. \n 2. These men will ultimately want to kill her, often times chop her to bits. \n 3. But Tomie almost cannot die. She heals most of her nonfatal wounds very fast. \n 4. Whenever a body part is chopped off of her, that part spawns another living Tomie. \n When these four things are combined, a genuinely eerie cycle of gore, murders and tons and tons of bitching Tomies. \n Tomie's stories are told in chapters, vaguely connected with each other. I can even say that it is a collection of standalone short stories that have a beginning act, a second act and always a horrific conclusion. This book gets its strength from the harrowing details of Junji Ito's illustrations, giving it a uniquely dark psychological feel of a world totally ruled by this girl Tomie. Like his other works, Tomie gives the readers an uneasy feel of a large-scale, town-wide claustrophobia where everybody is trapped in this seemingly insurmountable problem. This theme can be seen in his other works Gyo and Uzumaki. \n Collecting more than a decade of Ito's works, a reader can also see how the author gradually hones his crafts through the years. The only downside of it is that there is no story development at all. The chapters are good by themselves but they really do not add up to something that can be a worthy conclusion of the whole series. Like how do we stop this girl from invading and multiplying, or how to stop her from luring men to their demise. The last chapter offers tiny bit of resolution but nothing is really resolved at all. I think what Tomie needs is a protagonist. Someone who will be our eyes of the story's progression and the key as to how Tomie can be stopped. \n I recommend this Junji Ito manga if you are really into horror stuff. It is nicely bound and has some very disturbing imagery inside.",

        "text": "Siglo: Freedom is a collection of decade-by-decade stories from the Philippines' 20th century, told from the perspective of Filipinos who were alive during that period. Embedded in these chapters were either events of historical significance, like the battle of Bud Bagsak, and the rise and fall of \"emperor\" Florencio Entrencherado, or just life's snippets of that era like the comic fad of the 60s and 70s or the video gaming culture of the 90s. The stories are all standalone, each has its own interpretation of the concept of freedom. \n This compendium really has a brilliant motivation and a smart narrative that could immerse its readers in that particular time the story is set. It is a fine example of how graphic literature can be effective as a storytelling device, where this time the story to tell is the history of the Philippines. \n However, Siglo: Freedom falls short on the technical side. For a graphic novel that is is focused on the concept of freedom, this is very uninspired. Each chapter can barely tell a solid story. The dialogue on most stories is disjointed and meanders to oblivion, not to mention that it is way off to the lingua franca of that partucular time. This takes too much away from a supposed immersion. Even some stories have historical events which were forcefully lodged in the story. The editors could have done more to come up with a more cohesive volume. \n But the book has its good moments. I particularly liked the first one and the story written and drawn by Gerry Alanguilan.",

        "text": "The Fifth Beatle is a good example on how biography can be told more colorfully in the graphic form of literature. Vivek Tiwary's interpretation of the life of The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein can be best described as a life of a man who has devoted his life to bringing the British pop-ballad band on top of the world, which has led to his own demise. \n The matador philosophy embedded in the Fifth Beatle adds some interesting layers in an otherwise straightforward story of a person's career. Brian Epstein's reverence to this sport gives meat to his restrained queer sexuality, as he is an unrelenting bull with an intense inner desire to be dominated by an alpha male, a ruthless matador that will drive him to his best but ultimately will be the cause of his death. The bull-matador relationship also reflects his role as a manager of the Beatles. And I think this is what the book is explicitly telling its readers: Epstein, the matador showing to the crowd the glory of the bull, The Beatles, guiding them in this elaborate dance of their lifetime in a public arena, before he gives the final blow to the fierce animal. \n Brian Epstein's persona is thoroughly fleshed-out, even though I really do not know which one is fact and which one is the author's creative interpretation. The other character's personalities pale in comparison. The Beatles themselves were most of the time one-dimensional here. I get it, since after all this is an Epstein story, but it could have been good if his personal relationship with each of the band members were dealt with too. \n Artwork is fine and good to look at (I have a ton of fun reading the group's fiasco in the Philippines. Making fun of corrupt politicians is the best!), the colors and the fashion of that era are refreshing for my eyes. The facial expressions, I have no problem with them per se, it's just they've become very repetitive. Other than that, The Fifth Beatle's artwork is something worth seeing. \n The hardcover and the high-quality paper is also something to point out in this book. It easily stands out in your shelf or your coffee table, and a good source of small talk with your book lover friends. \n The Fifth Beatle is good read even for those who are not The Beatles fans. This is not my cup of tea but I understand why this book has garnered many praise.",

        "text": "The second volume of Orange, The Complete Collection still has some emotionally driven stuff to tell, and I admit that my heart has been tugged a few times. But volume two has a narrative that is not as solid and cohesive as the first one. The time jumps are not as organic as they were before. I also felt that the themes of being strong, not giving up and saving a life have been used over and over again that it felt that Orange should have been more effective if it were shorter, yet the ending happened so fast that the story could have used a couple more pages. \n The ending resolution is exactly the way you have perceived it will end. It's quite a bummer if it ended the other way around. I would also like some reconciliation to happen with the future group, like a grown-up Kakeru showing up in an epilogue chapter fulfilling the wish of the \"original\" ones . \n As for the six characters they are all extremely likeable until the end (even though Kakeru is douchey many times and Naho almost got to my nerves for her \"Naho-isms\"), but the only personalities that have been fleshed out are Naho, Suwa and Kakeru's. \n There's also a completely different story after the end of Orange. I didn't like it. \n Orange lives up to its readers expectations. It is warm, heartbreaking at times but most importantly, it is a testament about the good things that life can offer, even at times when one doesn't feel like going on. It is a celebration of friendship, love and happiness.",

        "text": "Seinen manga has been a staple subgenre in my comics collection. Orange is shoujo, and my last experience with this (and definitely not seinen) type of slice-of-life YA Japanese literature is through the anime, Boys Be. That was years ago, and I remembered that I was totally hooked every episode. \n Now that I am significantly old for the material, I never really knew what to feel at first reading this shoujo manga, Orange. But as the reading progresses, the beautiful yet sad story unfolds unfolds right to my eyes and directly to my heart. I felt young again, a time when innocence and ignorance from all the responsibilities are still unseen in the horizon, a simpler time in school, where my everydays are motivated by childish love, friends and crushes. And of course, those heartbreaks. Oh, those were the days. \n Orange has a special story about love, regret and friendship that is ought to be read by all. It plays with the heart's all-time question of regret: if I can change the past, what would that be? For future Naho, it is for her past self to save her dear friend Kakeru. \n Orange plays with your heart, excellently blending teenage love and friendship with heavier themes like loneliness, regret and the value of life. The sci-fi elements of time travel is there to set the plot of the whole story. \n I have never expected Orange to be that moving even at my age. After finishing volume one of the complete collection, I do care about the characters, not only with Kakeru and Naho, but all of them. \n Orange also is a window for foreigners to see the Japanese society, at least how their youth behaves, and there's some romance with them not being straightforward emotion-wise. There is definitely a darker side in this story though. It is the reality of suicide and death. But I'm glad that Ichigo Takano conveys these dark elements in a good way. \n There is still volume 2 in this awesome collection, I do hope Orange is beautiful and heart-warming until the end.",

        "text": "Reading A.D. Death without any clue what the back story really is got me so confused. I mean, what the heck is happening here? If not with the book's description here in Goodreads, I have no idea that this is a story about humans finding the breakthrough formula in conquering death, hence the title of this three-part series. \n A.D. After Death at its best is an intriguing take about our species under the premise of being literally immortals. And with Scott Snyder and Jeff Lemire on the reins of the creative chariot, nothing could go wrong. Unfortunately, A.D is very flawed. So intriguing may be a good word to describe this, but I prefer this one: incohesive. \n For example, there are these panels where our protagonist Jonah is in this some kind of jungle, then suddenly a hentai tentacle plant or something attacked him (and without having known of the plot beforehand, this would pass for a weird alien invasion thing). Of course, there will be some kind of explanation on how this will fit in with the whole story. But that left me more confused than intrigued. For those who have read Trillium, it also felt that Lemire cut those pages out of that book and pasted it in A.D. \n So our main guy Jonah Cooke who had a tragic past turns out to be a klepto, he stole a cow (named Darwyn, an absolutely awkward tribute to the late Darwyn Cooke) which is vital to the story somehow, then he left the barn or something like that to go into this fututistic-ish mountain town and work in a SETI-like lab with rainbow clouds somehow seen outside the window as a reliever to a woman he seemed to haved loved before but he will forget soon because for f*ck's sake I do not know the side effects of being immortal! That is how vague this book one is! \n There's even an illustrated story (nope, not a comics) embedded inside. I didn't hate reading it, but it also felt like a lazy take on an otherwise beautifully sad flashback that could have been best told in panels than paragraphs. \n Snyder's narrative style of beefing the story with mystery and wiki-worthy information just doesn't fit with Lemire's trademark themes on loneliness and separation. These two guys doesn't blend perfectly to tell a convincing tale. They honestly need to deal with their creative differences and come up with a better book two.",

I won't be spoiling it for you, so let us just say that volume two focuses on the other main character of the series, Coach Boss. \n The plot of Gridiron is a flashback story of how Euless Boss gets to be the coach of Craw County's Runnin' Rebs football team. And what can you expect from a Jason Aaron? Of course this backstory gets twisted and very ugly. He may not be as strong and physical as that old bastard bear Earl Tubbs, but Boss gets what he wants regardless of the price. The the sort of man Boss is. \n The other Jason (Latour) on the other hand perfectly paints the gritty and bloody tone of Aaron's writing style. Latour is the best artist to draw the ugliest faces, and yes that is a compliment. I mean, most of the faces here are like ugly caricatures of politicians in editorial cartoons! But again, I love the awfulness. You cannot fully enjoy Southern Bastards with pretty and clean faces. \n Southern Bastards may have been excellent in painting the ugly setting, but with eight issues in, the readers are still in the gray as to the exact plot of the series will be. Nonetheless, I still have my full trust on Aaron on where he will bring us with the story. If this guy delivered excellently in Scalped, then why not with Southern Bastards?",

        "text": "Oh, I am definitely at the minority here. Scott Pilgrim's Finest Hour is my least favorite volume in the series. \n Before I get to this particular volume, let me say first that the whole Scott Pilgrim series is a very worthwhile read. There is nothing that is near it. The mashup of Japanese with western pop culture makes it unique. Bryan Lee O'Malley has definitely crafted a classic. The whole series is a four stars for me. \n Now back with the final volume. The best I can say is that it is a fitting conclusion to this crazy story. If there's one word that summarizes this particular book, it is maturity. But you see, that is my problem with volume six. This maturity theme takes so much fun away from the story. Everyone (except for Scott) sort of changed and moved on. The thing is, I just wanted a silly book about juveniles with all those hilarious pop culture references in music and gaming, getting crazy and lousy with love or perhaps their perception of it. I wasn't ready for the unexpected serious undertones. The buildup towards the Gideon fight was full of exposition and self-realization, and I cringed reading those pages (that Nega Scott thing, the sabbatical wilderness stuff and the cryo-frozen fan-service anime girls Gideon has been collecting). The Saiyan Gideon inside Ramona's mind, treating her like some BDSM material gave me very uncomfortable sensations. It is just waaaay off. \n So to summarize what I have written so far: it is not that I hate this maturity thing in the final volume, it is just I do not want it in this material. Scott Pilgrim for me is meant to be an unadulterated guilty-pleasure graphic literature, free from preaching and the horrors of understanding what it is to be adults. \n The biggest contradiction though is Scott Pilgrim getting on with Ramona Flowers! If Scott truly understood maturity, he would not have chosen Ramona IMHO. Hell, he could have been with Knives or Lisa, or even Kim! I guess it is the power of Backstreet Boys' \"As Long as You Love Me\" perception of love which prevailed, eh? \n So again, let me be clear, the narration is solid, I just don't like how it turned out to be. There were no disjointed panels like the ones I have mentioned in the previous volumes. Artwork is inconsistent in some pages, but this is a nitpick so it is not a big issue. Thus the two stars is more of a personal preference/rant and not a score from a technical standpoint.",

Not that it would stop me from finishing Scott Pilgrim since there's only one volume left, but volume five is very underwhelming. The Pilgrim vs. the Twins fight is muddled by exposition and uninspired dialogue. I am not interested with this sudden coldness of Ramona towards Scott. Her mysterious disappearance IMHO would have been more impactful if the two were in very good terms. \n In fairness with the material, much of the blandness I have experienced in this volume perhaps is due to me reading the series straight for almost a week now. And as with any series, reading fatigue is likely to be experienced at a certain level no matter how good the work is. \n Don't get me wrong with the two-star though, volume 5 still delivers the trademark Scott Pilgrim humor and intensity.

The scene with Scott and Lisa together in the latter's apartment, with all their pent-up emotions for each other in this awkward-sexy-childish and definitely intense situation, it definitely took me back to those years where I have felt them too. \n The mysterious samurai man who turns out to be Knives' dad and this half-ninja ex of Ramona's make some cool swordfights ala-Kill Bill and all other samurai clashes we have seen. RPG elements are definitely here - the level-ups, the items and the Zelda-ish dreams. The subspace gets utilized more in this book, and readers will know how it sorta functions until they see this weird BDSM-ish scene with Ramona in it. What the heck was that? \n Anyway, the resolution at the end of volume four was kinda expected though it was mushy and funny at the same time. But yeah, I would definitely go with Lisa instead of Ramona. Just saying. So yeah, Lisa rules.",

        "text": "The crazy oddities of juvenile pop-rock-gaming saga of Scott Pilgrim continues! And yes it does deliver. The Pilgrim vs. Todd fight is clearly the crown of this book, though the cleverly written conclusion of the battle is lazily written too. Clever, but lazy. \n There are some issues the series (as far as volumes two are three are concerned) have. The book's flashback scenes are inserted here and there like crazy. Most of the time they are appropriate, but there are times when these flashbacks confused me or killed the intensity of the present scenes. Disjointed panels can also be seen, like there were lapses or panels that have been edited out of the material. Also, I wonder if these one-panel fourth wall breaks will persist through the last three volumes. The fourth wall breaks are not annoying though, just a bit off, even considering the crazy stuff happening there. \n Halfway through, and there are still four (or five, maybe three?) evil ex-boyfriends left. Oh yeah Scott Pilgrim, I'm in.",

Other than that, this is an enjoyable read! \n The main plot of defeating Ramona's seven evil ex-boyfriends still gets me going with reading the series and I actually am excited who Scott Pilgrim will battle next. His fight with Lucas Lee (or Luke Wilson, haha) was a bit underwhelming but it was funny and smart. \n In this book we also get a bit of character personality changes and backstories as Bryan O'Malley fleshes out each character. I find Kim P.'s story at the first pages of the book particularly cute and interesting. \n There are a few fourth wall breaks here and there but they are not Deadpool-level. \n Volume 1 in my opinion is better than this one in terms of writing, but the fun level keeps on increasing.",

Scott Pilgrim tells the story of this douchey eponymous protagonist who simultaneously dated two girls: Knives Chau, a cute high school chinese gal who Scott met in a deliberately cliched \"let me help you pick up your things\" act, and Ramona Flowers, an Amazon delivery girl who mysteriously appeared in Scott's dreams before he even see her in real life. \n Precious Little Life is cute and funny.

The characters all have their parts, though not equally, but balanced. Top 10, with its sheer number of characters does not feel congested, far from it actually. It is a cohesive creation of police drama, humor, sleuthing and comic parodies/references. \n The only sad thing about this is that Alan Moore never followed up the main series (besides spin-offes, a short-lived season two actually happened a couple of years after). The universe here is so rich that there are still innumerable interesting things readers are yet to experience. \n Top 10, beyond its story, also touches on social themes sprinkled across its characters and world: LGBT, racism, pedophilia, and other pop culture elements surrounding the late 90s. \n Watchmen may be a bleak representation of what the real world would be if superheroes exist, while Top 10 is a celebration of why we love superheroes. The diversity and richness of its world is worth visiting.",

This is a great improvement from Abrera's 12, which is more of a collection of meandering thoughts than effective stories. Kikomachine readers would get a tad more entertainment here, being accustomed to Manix' brand of magic realism and gore humor. \n Engaging as they are, 14 still does not justify the 500 Pesos tag price.

        "text": "I've been doing an Alan Moore marathon lately, and Top 10 has been my third in this wave, after Providence and that awful Terra Obscura. \n Alan Moore's Watchmen is the reason why I got into comics, and since then I've gradually filled my bookshelf with his creations. First, the must-buys like V for Vendetta, From Hell and the League of Extra Ordinary Gentlemen (I sadly haven't read Swamp Thing yet) then with his other works like Promethea, Lost Girls, Neonomicon and A Small Killing. Top 10 is my third and current wave of reading Alan Moore titles. \n Top 10 is set in a society where everyone has some sort of ability. It is a sci-fi fantasy where humans live with monsters, cyborgs, aliens, droids and even gods. Top 10 is what the police department is called there. \n I love the sheer variety of the characters in Top 10. They are not just super strong dudes who can fly. Each member of the eponymous police department is competent yet lacks some skills that others have. Alan Moore has effectively jumbled them in numerous police activities like arrests and crime-solving in weird and wacky ways. \n Top 10 matches Transmetropolitan in terms of the world-building, which is a neo-techno-dystopian future. The world is how Moore imagined it if having superpowers or some sort of metahuman ability is the norm. \n A seven-issue volume one, though self-contained in most aspects has some plots that are yet to be solved in the next volume, which just runs for five issues. This is worth reading.",

        "text": "Ooh a Jacen Burrows and Alan Moore book! Why not? Having read Neonomicon years ago, Providence provides another healthy and more detailed dose of Lovecraftian mythos to readers who are craving for such, seamlessly amalgamated to american witchcraft culture. \n Providence is definitely not a read for everybody. It is not for easy reading. Providence requires some sitting and an ample amount of rest in between in order to fully digest what the material offers to its readers. As the back cover says, Providence is well-researched and man it shows in this wordy graphic novel. \n Act one sets the overall tone and pacing of the story, and Alan Moore doesn't care if the story moves like an introverted sloth. He gives us details of the mythology one baby step at a time, hanging and suspending us readers to what is really happening behind the comic panels. The main plot can be easily summarized as Robert Black writing a book about America's \"hidden\" history and decided to pursue a lead which takes him to the occult world of witchcraft and sea-myths, along the way encountering increasingly weird characters. \n The mystery is obvious in the book, hiding in plain sight. Yet Alan Moore, in his smart narrative technique does not fully acknowledge what is really happening. He lets the readers wonder what in the world is happening, which is not much by the way. But the tone and overall mood compensates what is lacking in story development. The texts, though long and sometimes meanders away from the focus, are entertaining to read, giving extra read time which justifies its relatively higher price. \n Many little issues are also seen here, like homosexuality, racism, sex, persecution and the Prohibition. These stuff add variety and color to an otherwise straightforward story. \n Again, Providence is a fine read which is not for everybody.",

        "text": "By the butt of the Hutt! Darth Vader is so badass, kicking so many rebel ass that I almost pity those X-Wing pilots who were absolutely no match for the Sith Lord. Bring it on Vader! \n This issue is filled with beautiful and intense illustrations, many of which are these stunning spread pages that you would just admire for a few moments. Damn good stuff Deodato! \n This much X-Wings against a Sith Lord? Pfft, not enough. \n For those who are reading the Darth Vader comics, this is definitely a refreshing take on the character. Vader being downed, with no comms and means to call backup actually gives him the freedom to move, free from the eyes of the Empire. \n Vader Down already feels like a Star Wars episode 4.5. I highly recommend that you read this issue. Hopefully the next 5 of this six-issue miniseries will be as good as this one.",

The story is smart, fast-paced and comsistent with the movies. \n Original review (unedited): \n Okay, the good thing with issue number 12 is that the arc has concluded, although in a very underwhelming fashion. Everything were too convenient to happen. The story plays out on its own. \n The bad thing is, Thanoth emerged as a disappointing red herring after all. I'm quite disappointed how he was built up as someone who is cunningly intelligent and someone who puts his nose to somewhere it is not supposed to. \n Vader Down commences after this issue. And Marvel is too evil to publish a standalone issue number one instead of just starting the arc with either the Star Wars series or the Darth Vader comics.",

The first half was all action where Darth Vader fights these apprentice \"Vader replacements\" the emperor prepares just in case Vader fails again. It was kind of a dick move by the emperor but everything was justified (conveniently) as the ways of the dark side of the Force. \n The second half was gold, a classic comics scene where Vader learned that the one who destroyed the Death Star was his very own son. This is something that culminated in what all of us knew, the \"I am your father\" scene in Episode V. Flashback panels straight from the movie (Episode III) are abundant here. The emotions behind the mask are effectively shown to us through words and actions, both subtle and obvious. \n The Boba Fett scene puts the sweet golden glaze in this issue. It was the first time Vader learned about the mysterious Force-strong man who destroyed the Death Star. Just read this issue and you will know what I am saying.",

So Darth Vader issue one? Yeah, it is great. \n This extended canon (I believe so) happened right after the events of Episode IV where we all know that the rebels stole the plans of the planet-weapon and ultimately destroys it. Vader is to be blamed for the disaster, at least the only one alive to take the responsibility. \n A casual fan would right away feel at home with the comics, with the familiar text crawl and the galaxy far, far away phrase at the start. So familiar that the fanfare Star Wars music rings in my mind when I started reading it. The familiarity then extends to the characters, from Hutt the bounty hunter, the emperor and jedis. \n Subtle elements that give references to the movie are abundant here as well, Gillen doesn't force-feed to the readers other things, instead gives them as subtle hints, either in imagery or in dialogue. \n Vader is the protagonist in this series obviously. And he us effectively portrayed here as an intimidating, yet broken inside character. Vader is Vader. He is one of the villains that we care for. \n I am happy to have collected all 25 issues of this series. Darth Vader will surely be a memorable read for me.",

We see the story through Sail, who one time encountered a witch tree-engulfing a girl who has been bullying Sail since childhood. \n Written by Scott Snyder amd drawn by Jock, this would easily be a blockbuster series. But sadly it isn't. It may be a personal preference since all the creepy stuff are there, but I'm not really sold by them. \n What I am saying is, there are some creepier stuff out there in comics, take Alan Moore's Neonomicon or Junji Ito's Uzumaki.",

Reborn teams Mark Millar with none other than Greg Capullo about a story about being born again, not in heaven or as an animal, but in some fantasy world where dragons are alive and large axes are abundant. \n The first thing that you will notice is that Reborn looks like the new 52 Batman! That is not a surprise since many names in the Batman series also show up in Reborn, most notably Capullo. So it feels like you are reading Batman. I actually miss the Snyder-Capullo tandem. \n Back to Reborn. The whole series would be a tad less interesting if not for the whole \"life after death\" thing. Minus that, this is just a generic fantasy, with the evil side almost winning until \"the promised one\" arrives. Thus I hope that the being born again thing would give a significant bearing to the story, aside from just providing the fantasy world with fresh soldier meat.",

Since Two-Face is the main villain here, I love how Scott Snyder puts the element of duality (between Batman and Two-Face, Wayne and Dent) in his stories. \n The series still continues to show both minor and major characters. This after all is an All-Star series. Yet the star of the show is still Batman. \n John Romita Jr.'s art takes some time to appreciate but tbh, the Snyder-Capullo team would make a far better series than an SS-JRJR tandem. The art is the one which kept me from rating the issues a star higher. \n Most of us still do not know where Snyder is taking us. That us fine with me. Duke is becoming a trustworthy ally (not sidekick as Batman reiterates) and sure has a place in the Bat-family.",

If you come to read this hoping to answer questions like what TRULY it is to become a Wonder Woman or what is the legacy of Wonder Woman, this issue will disappoint you. \n Not that the stories have nothing sensible to tell, it is that too few pages are devoted to each stories that most of them come out shallow and obvious because of this constraint.

Noelle Stevenson clearly knows how to entertain an awfully large range of readers, not just age-wise, but readers from those who just wanted the fun out of the material and those who will do anything to spark an in-depth discourse to just about anybody about what they have read. It is Nimona's simplicity and charm that has captured the hearts of so many. \n Nimona is set in a medieval fantasy world where magic, knights and dragons are real. Yet it has huge chunks of sci-fi and modern elements in it. The eponymous protagonist is a shapeshifter girl who teams up with an older ex-knight-turned-villain. They go on doing their evil plans against a shady institution. \n It is so easy to get hooked by the book. The character Nimona is charming and interesting AF that you'd almost instantly invest in knowing more about her. What's her story? What happened to her? How powerful is she? \n As the story progresses, the whole story becomes deeper and darker. There's the typical dark science secrets that are uncovered, as well as expositions on some events on the past. Nimona though, does not go full dark and brooding. When all things seem to go down that road, the story finds its way to light up again. \n The story can be taken as is, although several non-fantasy elements are also there. You'd have this government figure which thinks it is doing the right thing, the moral burden of killing and even sexuality of the characters. Again, going into these things are entirely optional since the story and art itself are enough reasons for you to read it. \n Nimona is certainly one of those books you can recommend to just anybody.",

There were no lancing of eyes, no pervy killer dragons, or head popping, or any of that sort. This is the most feel-good, violence-free run Saga has ever made and it is beautiful. \n What I love about Saga is that in each volume, you'd get something from it, perhaps an imagery that haunts you for a few days, or that feeling of vastness and freedom, or a few laughs from those small talks that make each character in the story rich in personality. \n Volume six gives you happiness. It steers away from all the wars and gore. Brian Vaughan focuses on themes like family, the very concept which drives you literally crazy and go to the most dangerous places of the universe. Vaughan instills to its readers that Saga, above all the space warfare and political conspiracy and all cultural and moral diversities, it is a story about family. The whole story is driven by this and will most likely end with this.",

Killing the Wolf in my opinion is almost an impossible job because 99% of the work is tracking this creature which appears randomly every month. And when I say randomly, the locations happen to be small American towns, not hugely populated cities. \n There's one particular scene in this issue I really hate: It's Dillon's reason why he wasn't able to kill the Wolf with the silver bullets (which I thought the reason was he didn't have a clear shot). He said he didn't kill it because there's a human inside that monster. WTF man, your family (or friends?) were murdered because of that thing. It took you some time to hunt the Wolf and you just let it go away? \n I hope the remaining issues would get better.",

Nothing much can be said except that it is straightforward and very easy to follow: guy is on a quest to kill this Wolf who gorily kills and eats its victims while changing the life of its host in some of the most twisted ways. \n I like the gore and heavy tone of Wolf Moon. The dialogue is not top notch, almost amateurish for a Vertigo publication but I will reserve my full judgment until I read all six issues.",

        "text": "Bloom, while far away from being a mediocre Batman story arc is not the one that I have expected from Scott Snyder. He's been killing it for five years now, giving us a series that continuously satisfied our Bat nerdiness, both in depth and action-entertainment. \n This arc though, it doesn't live to the name of Snyder and Capullo. I liked the concept of Gordon as Batman, he's funny and sarcastic, constantly saying his disgust over the idea, yet he does it anyway. The cowl (or I say, the armor) is just too heavy for him to handle. Mr. Bloom on the other hand, I really don't get what he is trying to prove. He says he's the cure, \"entrusting\" the power to the people of Gotham through his seeds, yet he's also a murderer, a mob, an I don't know former Gotham city supergenius in nanotech gardener. You see, Mr. Bloom though the action in his story were bloombastic (hehe), he's out of place in Gotham City. \n The better part of this arc are definitely the quiet conversations. You know, Bruce's talk with Alfred to let him become the Batman again, I felt pity for Pennyworth, like as a reader, you want him to be back but you feel the other side too. Batman's talk with Gordon was gold too. You know, they've been through hell so many times and Gordon, with an apologetic tone tells him how much he has failed the city and especially Batman, his ally and most of all his friend. \n But the most endearing of all was Bruce's heart to heart talk with Joker (yes I know it is debatable but for me he's Joker) by the lake. That place, the peaceful place only the two of them knew was like their exclusive bro-zone. And I love how these two characters, in their own ways struggle after what happened to them post-Endgame. Two lost souls, life-long enemies just there talking about what has become of them. I felt for Joker. He doesn't want to be the Clown anymore. \n Bloom, even though I don't want to admit it, is my least favorite arc in Snyder's run. Even the two-part Clayface story felt better for me. I didn't hate volume 9 though, far from it in fact.",

        "text": "Rise of the Batman is definitely better than the first arc of DC Rebirth Batman (I Am Gotham). It is a fresh take on the series that seamlessly puts together a band of characters from the Batman mythos against a more technologically advanced army of \"Batmen\". It is part sleuthing, part drama and all action. \n Yes it is good. But is it also groundbreaking? No. Will it be remembered? Hmmm for some elements of it, yeah for a while. \n This first arc of Detective Comics (DetCom) kicks of the DC Rebirth era, it reverts to the original numbering (tschuss New52!). I am definitely into that because after all, DC is going back to its roots and that means going back to the original runs, at least for Detective and Action Comics. \n Thankfully, Batwoman is given the spotlight here, with a proper and grounded introduction to Kate Kane and her relationship with his cousin Bruce. Other characters are given screen time as well. You have Tim Drake, and I commend Tynion IV for handling him pretty good. Tim here is the good ol' Tim that we have read before - a geeky genius fellow with an upbeat attitude. There's also Orphan, the Spoiler and Clayface (yes, you read it right). And Clayface here is the comic relief of the group. Basil Karlo is not evil at heart and Clayface is such an adorable monster. \n Like I said before, this arc is not that groundbreaking. In fact, it is a set up for the next arc which is a crossover (this early eh?), the Monster Men. \n Sure Rise of the Batmen is helluva fun to read. It is a great collectible piece since this run goes back to the original DetCom numbering yet not that deep enough to be talked about in nerdy discourse.",

        "text": "Zero Year could have been rightfully called as Gotham and everything would be just the same. But Zero Year has a more nice ring to it, a sort of nod to Frank Miller's more grounded and brutal Year One (and still the definitive Batman origin story). \n Snyder, in his exceptionally well-written Batman arcs, always has a thesis in mind as the foundation and works the way up in the most amazing ways to deliver a montage of memorable Bat stories. In Zero Year, aside from a modern retelling of Batman's origin, Snyder establishes two tenets in the Batman mythos: number one, Bruce cannot be just a vigilante Bruce to take up crime on his hands, he has to be Batman and two, Gotham City needs Batman. Embedded in these two rudimentary philosophies are side stories that are seamlessly put together by the genius mind of Scott Snyder. We have Red Hood and The Jokers origin, the giant coin in the Batcave, the Batcave itself, the Bat-signal, the Batman-Gordon friendship and most notably an outstandingly good Riddler story. \n This is what happens when Edward Nygma rises up to the throne unchecked, undisputed and unrivaled. He has the capability to turn the City into a dark place. Although Snyder goes a bit in excess with all those drones and killer bots (but this is comics, I guess? Kinda like how can Bruce afford those large computers with large screens in the Batcave and all sorts of Batman stuff, or how can the Joker implement that elaborate plan in Death of the Family), this Zero Year is what separates The Riddler from the Clown Prince of Crime - The Joker is all about the laughs and his twisted love for Batman while the The Riddler takes so much pride in his intellectual prowess to a fault and openly challenges everybody to beat him and his riddles. \n As a short aside, can I just say that Greg Capullo kills it big time in Zero Year? I mean o my god. This guy draws exceptionally fantastic! Capullo (and Danny Miki of course) perfectly, I mean perfectly illustrates the story. The colors are vibrant with a significant touch of lush green, the postapocalyptic-ish rendering of Gotham City truly tells how it has been abandoned and given-up. \n Gotham City itself in Dark City is one large riddle. Freeing it from the hands of Nygma has become a personal mission for Batman. Alone, he cannot do it. The book shows to us that The Riddler is way intellectually superior to Bruce. So how did he beat the green skinny man? Snyder then displays us what Batman can do: 1. Bataman is a detective, devising a feasible plan to defeat the Riddler, solely figuring out where his lair is and even goes one-on-one brain-wise with The Riddler. 2. Batman has the technology and gadgets to do his, though in Zero Year they are still crude, they do the job. 3. He has allies. Bruce has Gordon as his wingman, Lucius Fox as his tech expert and Alfred as the one who will tend to his needs. And finally, 4. Batman has the physical advantage, the muscle to punch Edward Nygma (hugely gratifying) and stomp him to oblivion. \n So whenever Batman says that Gotham \"is my city\". This is the definitive justification why he has rightfully earned it. \n Saying that Zero Year is a Batman origin story is an oversimplification of what it really is. It is a study of the rudimentary ideals that make up the Batman: a detective, a vigilante, a hero. It is a baptism by blood of the City itself. Zero Year is a modern tale, deep and at the same time entertaining, a literature that everybody should read.",

Like many 80s and 90s comics, it is dark, filled with words and adjectives that would make an emo kid orgasm. Spawn/Batman after all is a 90s comic. The artwork is a blast from the past with all those weird aesthetics in the costume and and exaggerated movements. \n Spawn/Batman is an okay story, with an edge amongst other okay stories because this is a team up of the Dark Knight and the Hellspawn.",

When you think all goes well in its first three issues, everything went south thereafter. I am Gotham fails to tell a story and became so busy in setting up the next one. Building up for the next arc is a good thing really, it is a way to show readers that everything connects to a bigger picture, given that you are telling the current story good. But this one isn't. \n God, aside from that, this story is so wrong in many things: \n 1. Alfred in the Bat cowl is a huge disgrace. I know it was meant for a comic relief but that was severely awkward and unwarranted. \n 2. Gotham and Gotham Girl are annoying. Duke and Batman even spent precious panels just to comfort an whining, emo Gotham Girl. They started truly good though, giving an element of inspiration and youth in the dark city of Gotham. \n 3. Psycho Pirate and Hugo Strange not getting enough screen time. It's not just I wanted to see more of them, but they were so vital in the story. They were the ones responsible for the downfall of the Gotham duo! Instead we learned about it as an exposition from Amanda Waller. \n 4. Underutilized Justice League. They were literally just there for a squad pose then went ass-kicked by Gotham. (I dunno, but if your \"life-force\" is what gives you power, your whole life is in no way enough in taking down Superman, or the whole League for that matter. So if I were a villain who provides that type of life-force, I'd just train a couple of kamikaze Gothams to defeat JL.) \n 5. Amanda Waller. She's conveniently placed there for exposition (#3) and as well as telling what would happen next. This is not a suicide Squad Series. This is Batman! \n If this book hits the shelves, I recommend that you skip it. Go buy Detective Comics: The Rise of Batmen (Tynion IV) or Superman: Son of Superman (Gleason and Tomasi) instead.",

The problem is, there weren't enough issues to show who they really are and just for you know, for readers get to know them deeper. They're good folks, siblings who idolize the Batman. Then they went crazy. \n So what happened in this issue? Batman helped Gotham Girl to move on. Period. That's it. Oh there's that setup for the next arc. This issue is a waste of money. Again I say what I've said in my previous review: we could have seen more of the Psycho-Pirate and Hugo Strange. \n Another problem for the I am Gotham arc is that it is too busy setting up the next arc it for got to tell a story. In almost every issue, there is a reference about the Monster Men. Detective Comics on the other hand also gives references to that as well but it was okay because DetCom is telling a solid story. \n That was why The Court of Owls was good. Snyder (plus his great writing) was given a whole year to explore the Court, exploding with greatness in each chapter. He neither set up nor tell what the next arc would be in the panels, only in interviews. Snyder never forgot to tell a story. The DC Rebirth Batman has that potential, but never fully utilized. \n Amanda Waller, god why does she have to explain half the story? First with what Strange and Psycho-Pirate did, next with the mission briefing scene for the next arc, which possibly features Bane. Man, Waller and Batman are supposed in a word warfare like rappers on steroids! Word exposition and mission briefing are for Task Force X members. She has cool moments though (the General Lane scene) but most of the time, she's there to conveniently tell what the creative team couldn't show us. \n Batman Rebirth series is off to a disappointing start.

Yeah, it was hilarious, and for a moment I thought that after that overly dark issue four, things are going to be light after all. But no, that scene between Alfred-Batman and Gotham was just way to off with the rest of the events in the issue. \n Second, there's Gotham Girl, a whiny brooding teenage girl who overcame his fear after a good rest and a heart to heart talk with Duke. Seriously, playing P!nk's F*cking Perfect would give the very same result in a faster time and more efficiently (and Duke would have concentrated helping Batman). I want to feel for Gotham Girl, empathize with what she's dealing. But the way Tom King has handled her character, so much has been wasted man. \n Third, the appearance of the Justice League. Aside from Superman and one of the Green Lantern's participation, what did the other league members do? Nothing. They just pose for the camera for a nice JL wide angle shot. Their only reason to be there is to show how Gotham is strong and how he can easily subdue the members of the League.. That's it. I really, really felt that the Batman series could have used one more issue to at least give some more hero time for Gotham and Gotham Girl, an issue that makes the readers root for them and be emotionally invested with them. \n Lastly, the clunky narration. I mean, I could just be so dumb not getting the essence of the narrative especially at the last part of the issue. \n Left with almost no choice, I'm still giving the Batman series a shot.",

        "text": "At last, Detective Comics Rebirth gears up towards a full blast. This series is consistently good in this Rebirth era. I love how James Tynion IV handles a relatively large cast of characters and still effectively tell a cohesive and interesting story. \n So there's a group of people whole themselves as the League of Shadows. I wonder how they are connected with R'as al Ghul. This surely brings back a lot of 90s stuff told in a modern fashion. Perfect, just perfect if this turns out to be true. \n There's this young guy named Ulysses Armstrong who got extra panels than the other guys in the League. I wonder if he's going to be part of the Bat family. I mean, a dedicated tech guy who is an absolute nerd? That would be a fun addition to the ever-changing team. \n There are less Kate Kane moments here, but I don't complain because Batman clearly is the focus of the issue. I particularly want to say that the first page where LoS guys try to catalog all the stuff in Batman's utility belt is such a joy to read. \n Detective Comics shows that it is one of the best series in the DC Rebirth era, and they haven't started the big bang yet.",

And this will go down nowhere but in Gotham City. The Batman series mentioned about the monster men, so maybe athey are talking about the same thing? I dunno, just a guess. \n Batwoman, since her fantastic J.H. Williams run has never been given the proper amount of time to shine, and most importantly, to lead. This is something that Batman lacks. He works alone so he doesn't seem to be good at leading. But Kane here in the other hand has the proper motivation and training to do the job. Way to go! \n Clayface, I just love this guy.

Everything is still in the dark in issue three, but it guarantees that more things will be revealed in issue number four. \n I am particularly interested with a villain who revealed himself at the last page. DC Rebirth is full of surprises! I briefly read about him in Infinite Crisis and never in The New 52. \n What surprised me though is that I Am Gotham part three (this issue) reads like a Snyder story. The art then weirdly felt like a Capullo too. Not that I am complaining, but it is just something worth pointing out. \n Gotham and Gotham Girl's story is as generic as paracetamol, yet still a fun read. Their superpower origins are yet to be revealed though, which is absolutely okay with me since Tom King has all the time writing Batman. And yes I like the optimistic vibe the duo radiate, something that kinda affects Batman in a good way. \n In what good way? Well, Batman is a bit less brooding and dark since Rebirth started. He's now more of an inspiration. Not of Superman's level though.",

I am interested to see how DC handles her character in Rebirth. I loved J.H. Williams' Batwoman run in The New 52 until DC ruined it bigtime. \n Comparing the second issues of Rebirth Batman titles, I choose Batman #2 to be better this time.

And the cards from both sides are slowly dealt on the table: on the good side you have Bats, the two Gothams, the Commissioner and Alfred; while on the right, you have the yet to be revealed Monster Men, Hugo Strange and (unexpectedly) Amanda Waller. \n We saw a bit of action with the first few pages of the issue, where the Gotham duo and Batman fight against Solomon Grundy. This is an acceptable way to see how the two new characters fare against the Caped Crusader. They have the potential to be great, they are strong, yet Batman is way, way better than them. \n Well, I am starting to like Gotham and Gotham Girl's addition in the Batman mythos (if they are to stay). Their fresh and on-the-job vibe gives the usually gritty Batman series a tinge of hope and youth. Perhaps it is how they resemble the Super family logo. \n Between Detective Comics and Batman, I like the former better. But I am a huge Batman fan, so I take pleasure in reading both new series.",

There are many things that I didn't see in volume five that I have constantly seen in the other four volumes. \n For one, gone are the ridiculousness of each scene and the story. The story is not anymore confident and bold. Everything becomes to generic and flat. Interesting characters like Bugnug and Bai Ya Shan almost didn't do anything at all, even Freeman's wife for that matter. \n Well at least Ryoicih Ikegami's art didn't go bad as the story.

This penultimate volume wraps up the arc where Freeman and the 108 Dragons defeated old enemies and starts a new one where the 108 Dragons is against maybe its strongest foe to date: the Kidnappong Organization. \n Yes, expect that this volume is full of perversions and fetishes where the main characters are almost nude everytime. The plot of this KO arc starts simple from saving a family to something like this (plot spoilers ahead): a sort of tournament that pits Freeman against the best Green Berets with an army of perverted Green Berets watching while they masturbate from the action they are seeing. Thus huge army actually make up the KO, with a beautiful leader that has extreme sexual fantasies with Freeman who, during the tournament fight also masturbates from the action she is seeing. O my god, that is ridiculously crazy. \n I cannot complain, because everthing is drawn so beautifully by Ryoichi Ikegami. He has a talent of drawing beautiful people poses, men and women alike, has a great knack for illustrating action scenes panel by panel, and drawing breathtaking cityscapes. \n I've given 5 stars to all 4 volumes of Crying Freeman.

        "text": "I thought that Batman #1 picks up after the one-shot Batman Rebirth issue. Fortunately, it isn't! This one is a continuation of Snyder and Capullo's epic New52 Batman run. Do you need to read the New52 Batman series? It is not necessary, but I highly recommend that you start there. The New52 Batman series is one of the few things that came out great from that era. \n Unlike Detective Comics, Batman comics is obviously a Bat-centric series, and here we see what the Caped Crusader can do. If you look at the issue cover, that pretty much summarizes the plot. There's Duke who has been introduced to us in the Rebirth one-shot (plus appearances during Snyder's run), Commissioner Gordon, an airplane with its tail on fire. Alfred is also in the issue. Then there's this couple in blue and gray, with a pentagon insignia ala-Superman, but with an old English letter of \"G\". They seriously have to work that letter because at first look, it looks like a \"B\". \n So Batman issue one doesn't really introduce these two characters, save for the last few pages, where some of their powers are revealed. They are heroes by the way. This issue is an entertaining read from start to finish. Finch's art style is good as ever and Tom King is a competent writer like Snyder. I just miss the latter's narrative style. \n We also see Batman's new costume after a hiatus in the wake of the events in Endgame and after Commissioner Gordon took up the mantle for a brief period. I like the new costume which kinda respects the old and the new. \n Is this a good start? Yes and so far I love what I am reading from DC Rebirth. Is this as good as Snyder's Batman issue one? I'm leaning towards Snyder's first issue. It was much more enjoyable. Is this better than Detective Comics #934? I cannot say, although I enjoyed DetCom more. \n The Batman series is alive as always. It is promising, it is both fresh and familiar.",

        "text": "DC Rebirth is here, so many things have changed for the better! Detective Comics is now back to its original numbering. See, you really do not need some renumbering of titles or a clean slate, all you need is a good start (Although I can also argue that the New52, for all the bad things that it gave to fans and readers alike, acted as a necessary ordeal. I mean, you won't have Rebirth without it, right?) . \n So there is a new, more advanced enemy and our Caped Crusader cannot do it alone. So he asked helped from Batwoman (who by the way had an awesome J.H. Williams run) to form a team tasked to surmount this inevitable conflict. \n I liked how Tynion made use of the DC characters in the Batman mythos who have been either scarce or totally absent during the New52 era. The author did not make me feel that the two Bats are recruiting them just for screen time. They felt as a start of something great, a team and a really good one. \n So DetCom #934 is a recruitment issue. And we have seen this so many times in movies and comics. The fun here is the variety of personalities during the recruitment and Tynion nails it. Despite each team members' action scenes lasting for only a few panels, they are effective and entertaining to see. But who I think stole the show are the villains: Azrael and Clayface. \n Jean-Paul Valley was a famous Batman character during the 90s, especially in the Knightfall era. He stole the show and embodied an \"aesthetic\" Batman that kinda reflects the comics of that decade. I got so excited seeing him again, updated in a \"Arkham Knight-esque\" costume. His spiritual personality is still intact, loyal to a fault to the Order. \n Then there is Basil Karlo, a.k.a. Clayface. Now, what's with DC making heroes out of villains? First Killer Croc in Suicide Squad (well, not really), then SuperLuthor then Clayface. Forever Evil proved to us that villains can become cool, effective heroes too. Haha, but Clayface ain't effective and cool. He's effective and cute! So Clayface being in the team is a good move! \n Barrows' subdued contrasts is effective in a DetCom landscape, obviously since this is a Batman comic. The choice of characters turns out to be a good choice of colors as well. There's Batman purple, Batwoman red among other colors. \n Rebuilding the Batman family in the face of uncertainty is a way to go for Detective Comics. I think we are in for one great ride.",

This one is more grounded, a gritty crime story (with a whiff of film noir) told from the perspective of his trusted henchman, Jonny Frost. So there is no groundbreaking stuff that happened here, just a slice of life, the life of a deranged murderer. \n The overall mood of Joker, if summarized into four adjectives is gritty, harsh, dark and dirty. The Azarrello-Bermejo tandem is the perfect pair for a story like this. Azarello can pull off some of the best street-level crime stories while Bermejo has that talent to draw muck and filth to faces and places and still call it beautiful. If Alex Ross' style is hope, then Lee Bermejo's is rot. \n Batman has made himself scarce here, something that gave Joker enough space and room to do what he wants too unchecked and unafraid. Again, there is nothing in the graphic novel that we haven't seen or known. If it weren't for Bermejo's art, Joker would end up as another generic story that is focused on the eponymous villain. \n Some of the villains in Batman's rogue gallery are there as well: Killer Croc, Two-Face, The Riddler, Penguin and Harley Quinn. Their level of importance vary from just a cameo appearance to a supporting character. \n Overall I got a lot of fun reading Joker though this may be skipped if you are just a casual reader of the Batman mythos.",

From melodramatic villains to unexpected sci-fi stuff, this volume of Crying Freeman is thoroughly entertaining. \n This manga is my guilty pleasure. It has so many sensual scenes that may in fact be cringe-worthy for others (I too, experience such in his other works: Lady Snowblood and Path of the Assassin in particular), but here I embrace such. For one, the women are downright strong here. You should not mess with them or else your life will be sent to the deepest levels of hell! \n The other reason why I enjoy reading Crying Freeman so much is its art. Ryoichi Ikegami draws so well, with confidence, detail and finesse. Ryoichi Ikegami's art is certainty. There is so much power and sexiness that manages to come out from each of his illustrations. His style is oozing with 70s to 80s manga and fashion, something that I have just felt and seen from the early years. \n The story of Crying Freeman now takes us back to where it all started. The tattooed assassin is now the leader of the 108 Dragons. He unexpectedly made some unexpected alliances and acquired a cursed weapon that her wife has sworn to be her possession. There is also some science stuff that is going on. So everything's even crazier than before! \n If you get a copy of this amazing series, read it right away.

And I say, despite it's explicit nudity, objectification of women, rape and obvious sexual fetishes, Lady Snowblood is a literature about revenge that should be read. \n The story is very much straightforward with a typical \"point A to point B\" type of narrative. There might be unrelated chapters of contract killings but that is totally okay. Lady Snowblood is a violent piece of literature that gnaws on the protagonist's dark past and sells itself as a cultural manga. \n To call Lady Snowblood Shura Yuki the female version of the Lone Wolf and Cub's Itto Ogami is a bit of an overstatement because this four volume manga is nowhere near the Lone Wolf in terms of story quality and artwork. Both Itto and Yuki just want to avenge their family.

        "text": "Wow, after almost a month of reading other titles (mainly Vertigo and DC comics) I finally got time to read the third volume of Lady Snowblood! It is still the same old revenge plot that I left last month, with Yuki still on the search of the ones who have disgraced her mother. \n It starts off right where the second volume ended. And I say again, there is too much female objectification here, so much machismo. And worse, the book gives in to such. In between the contract killings, sake drinks and other things is nudity and violation of womanhood in different levels. Can we just do away with such and get things done? \n But in fairness with the writing, I enjoyed this volume. The story may somewhat be eccentric at some point, but it is the way Koike delivers the story that makes the book beautiful, not to mention Kazuo Kamimura's equally beautiful artwork. I cannot deny that he draws the characters' emotions really well and the action scenes with poetic finesse. \n Lady Snowblood, right from the start is not a manga for everybody. It is unintentionally offensive, yet a very entertaining read.",

        "text": "This review will not go into the political theses that the whole series is shoving into its readers, for it may take a very, very long essay just for me to express how much Transmetropolitan reflects the political landscape, its limitations and how much more complex reality is. Transmetropolitan for the most part captures all the stench that us people would simply not smell, the ugly details in our own city and the scandals that might have transpired in our governement that we immediately forget because we are more interested in other things like, the next episode of a tv series, or cute cats, or what would our next profile picture would be like. \n I will give a review therefore on the technical details of the comics, and how each of its details affected my appreciation towards the material. \n First, I want to say that Warren Ellis is a brilliant writer, not just a comic book writer, but a writer writer. He can be able to sustain a reader's interest in his prose, even though there are many times that I felt that he is just saying the same things over and over. He also have these over-the-hedge array of random words, that when put together, crafts one nasty picture that only a deranged mind can concoct. He is the real Spider Jerusalem. \n Darick Robertson's art is as equally nasty as Ellis' writing. He made Spider a dirty bastard with inexplicable charm, his filthy assistants sexy, useful and filthy, and the Smiler oozing of political deceit. His use of bright colors and a highly contrasted palette exacerbates the violence, rowdiness and ugliness of the futuristic dystopian City. What Ellis says, Robertson shows. It is a dirty, beautiful tandem. \n The story on the other hand meanders at the middle of the series, picking up steam on the sevenrh or eight volume. I elt that Transmetropolitan could be better told in fewer issues. But this comment of course is highly subjective. I binged-read the whole series in two weeks, cramming everything into my brain a story that took the original issues years to tell. So I'm just warning you guys that Transmetropolitan is better experienced in small doses. \n The ending is what I expected it to be, happy with a sprinkle of sadness, as how many Vertigo series of that era has ended (I'm talking about Y The Last Man, Scalped ans Preacher) - a male protagonist too tired for the action but not completely retired, content to live in some place with grass and trees. \n Just a spoler here: I really, really wished to see Spider using his Bowel Disruptor on the president, in its highest setting, with all the details and splatters displayed in all of its brown glory, (pretty sick, eh?) but I didn't get that. How sad. \n I cannot imagine at first that I will read a journalism-themed comic book until the end, but Transmetropolitan is just that good. Read this one and it is like you are reading the real news.",

The Cure is fast-paced, non-stop and action-packed. \n It is also sad, and I cannot stop thinking about the real-world events that are happening right now that are eeriely reflected by the series, I mean, political cover-ups are everywhere.

Save for some action scenes, hasn't there been anything new, something that wasn't established in the previous volumes? \n Spider and his filthy assistants are on the run, yeah we know that. He now works for the Hole, so why the meeting? Hasn't it been established before that Spider and The Smiler are battling each other.

        "text": "What All-Star Batman lacks as of now is focus. Granted, Scott Snyder is handling a Two-Face story really well, knowing full well the villain's personality. Snyder is a genius in doing that, with what he did with Joker and The Riddler in his New52 Batman run, I have full trust in him that he can deliver a great Two-Face story. \n Going back, sure, All-Star Batman has a central thesis of \"going to somewhere\" story, which loosely ties all the villains just popping out of nowhere. They may be motivated by Two-Face's offer, but them showing up felt disjointed and uninspired. \n It is also new for me to read Snyder's style of telling the story at different time points, but I do not see the point doing it. He could have just told in in a linear fashion and that might be a tad better than how the story is being narrated. Perhaps I'm too early to judge and maybe there is a Nolan-esque reason for that, so let's just wait and see. \n Romita's art is fine, but there's nothing more to it. Of course I'm overly subjective with this matter, but I kept on imagining how Greg Capullo (or Sean Murphy and even Francis Manapul) will draw All-Star Batman. Romita's art is yet to impress me. \n Overall, All-Star Batman issue two is fine. It is an entertaining read but not a great one.",

So a dinner would be the best way for them to know each other, establish not just a team but true friendship, and what Manapul says in the comics: tear down walls. This may not be at the level of Alex Ross' witty and heartful lunch of the supertrio at a diner in Kingdom Come, but it serves the purpose of quickly building the foundation of DC's most iconic superheroes. I mean, Clark making fun of Bruce? That is gold. \n Manapul's clever use of the color palette rings with happiness, sorrow and hope, but mostly hope. He is a great choice for Trinity, not just as an artist but also as a writer. \n Trinity issue one is fresh, simple and humble.

Then Black Science faltered and started becoming mediocre. \n Seven to Eternity, thanks to Jerome Opena's undeniably great artwork also has the potential of being grand and beautiful. So I have very high hopes for Remender that he will utilize whatever stories the world of Zhal has into something worth reading and a comic series that is memorable and timeless. Pretty high expectations? Yes actually, because this first issue is that good (and an annoying tease). \n Jerome Opena's work here is an absolute beauty. The way he delivers the action and war, there is some kind of color poetry that is happening. The story may be a forgivable \"man on a quest to save family\" thing, but god, the art is so good to look at that I frequently stop and postpone reading the speech bubbles just to admire the illustrations. \n Seven to Eternity has a solid first issue.

This volume I can say is eerily timely. People are fed with bullsh*t news snippets from the so-called amfeed, basically what *ahem* social media feed us. There is a campaign going on and it is the fascist incumbent president vs. an equally crazy opposition. Whoever wins though, the sad truth is, evil will always prevail while the sensible ones are killed (literally, and I praise Darick Robertson for those graphic images). \n Spider Jerusalem shines as a character as he covers the campaign, unearthing skeletons and bringing down approval ratings overnight from just one column. This might be a far fetched idea nowadays - one person changing things, but the essence is this: journalism is cunning a virus, powerless by itself but life-changing at the very instance it latches on to someone, and by someone I mean the masses. So crazy as Jerusalem as he may be, he uses this for one thing: to show the truth. \n Jerusalem has a new assistant, Yelena. She's a likeable introvert. More intelligent but less physical than Spider's previous assistant Channon (who shows up in this volume).

        "text": "Warren Ellis has so much talent in him. Volume two felt like he could have been an effective journalist as well, a crazy one for that matter. \n Volume two fleshes out some more about Spider Jerusalem, the past that still haunts him today with a bodiless wife, a headless kid and one woman and a talking police mutt whose lives he has messed up before. \n Lust for Life did a bit a meandering before it actually develops into a cohesive story, though it does it well with the benefit of spanning for more issues as compared with the three-issue first arc. As his past is being fleshed out (I wonder now who is worse, Spider or Preacher's Cassidy) Channon, his assistant was brokenhearted because her boyfriend left her to become, err, a fog. The crazy things do also build up like a crazy conference of religions, reservations within the city and a radioactive suit-clad men who have a rather weird perception of taboos. \n I loved the writing, though I think it would take a couple more volumes for me to truly dig the journalism-based plot of Transmetropolitan.",

        "text": "Too much of something is not good. That cliffhanger end with Yuki Kishima facing the blackmailer was too much for me to absorb. Kazuo Koike certainly has his perversions, eh? But in fairness with the author (who I have utmost respect in Lone Wolf and Cub), Lady Snowblood must accurately depict the culture of 19th century Japan, including weird perverted practices and obvious objectification of women. \n On another note, Deep-Seated Grudge, part 2 fleshes out Yuki Kishima's origin story on how she became a formidable assassin. This volume also pits Lady Snowblood in a direct path to avenging her mother's tragic life and death. Those who have already read Lone Wolf and Cub may tread in familiar territory, but only in a much condensed and smaller scale. \n Kazuo Kamimura's artwork is graceful and flowing. Whenever Lady Snowblood is in a knife fight, there is some high level of artistic choreography you are feeling - a fast dance of blades and body and blood pictured in slow motion. \n Halfway through the series and things are finally set in motion, Yuki Kishima has now been strongly established as Lady Snowblood, an efficient and talented assassin seeking for revenge.",

        "text": "I am convincing myself that this volume of Crying Freeman 3 or 4 stars because these ratings I believe are the scores it deserves to have. Yet I admit, I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, a guilty pleasure I am a bit shy to admit. \n Crying Freeman is so self-aware that it can pull-off effective jokes despite a melodramatic mafia theme in many of its pages. It delivers ridiculous antics of violence and assassinations that kept me from reading ithe book until the end. And if I said ridiculous, I meant it, there is a kawaii assassin dressed with a chrome swimsuit with a cat picture in her rifle, fighting Freeman on top of a submarine. That was a fun sight to see! \n In this volume we also saw the extent of the power of the 108 Dragons, an organization that Freeman now (or will) leads. My only gripe with it is the sudden change of heart of Yo Hinomura from someone who is not free and cries after a kill to a totally badass Chinese mafia leader. \n A lot has happened and a lot has died in this chapter. I mean a LOT. I dont want to spoil you the details of this awesome volume, so read the book.",

        "text": "I asked myself before reading the first volume: my friends have recommended Transmetropolitan to me, but how on earth can a journalism-themed graphic novel interest so many. \n The answer is generic yet very effective: a phenomenal first volume. \n I have read so many titles with an awesome first volume. Many have kept me interested and excited until the end/current story arc (Chew, Sandman, Preacher, Scalped, Y The Last Man) while there are some that performed poorly after the first volume (Black Science, Sex Criminals). \n Transmetropolitan captures what the 90s is made of: beautifully chaotic and crazily colorful (not psychedelic because that would be the 70s), plus a handful of shitbombs here and there made by intelligence-inducing drug user gonzo journalist named Spider Jerusalem. \n Our protagonist definitely has a heart but is so fed up with urban pop culture / a city ripe with weird fashion statements, racial discrimination and prostitution with other \"normal\" people living their normal life that reacts violently whenever something radical shows ups in the news or whatever sources which they subjectively deem to be credible. In short, Spider is fed up by today's society. \n Warren Ellis' commentary about the transient riot that happened to be Spider's first comeback column in the series is brilliant in two ways. First, it is not bound by time. Something will come up somewhere and things will go down ugly in the end because someone did something nasty and everything blew out of proportions. That is just how evil and primal the core of humanity is. Everybody are warriors of a silly cause, defenders of self-righteous faith and fighters of subjective law. Nobody is right and nobody is wrong. All is in the middle of this civilized muddy ocean of sorts. Second, Transmetropolitan manages to be (and paradoxically) unbiased in a way that it presented the truth from all sides. Spider Jerusalem is not a self-righteous man, god he is far from it, yet he reports what he see without judging one side in favor of another. The way Ellis wrote the story, it is neither a preach nor a manifesto of a particular view. It is an opinionated truth, but still the truth. I just love how he manages to walk that very thin line. \n As my friends recommended this to me, I also recommend Transmetropolitan to you.",

        "text": "I am reading Lady Snowblood together with Crying Freeman. After reading their first volumes, which book I liked more, it is a very close fight, but I say it is Crying Freeman. The latter is a fresh read after reading Kazuo Koike's trilogy of stories with Goseki Kojima (Lone Wolf and Cub, Samurai Executioner and Path of the Assassin). Lady Snowblood, although its setting is 19th century Japan where the west is slowly establishing its influence. \n Lady Snowblood is very much like Ogami Itto of the Lone Wolf and Cub, they ate both assassins for hire while seeking for revenge against those who killed their family. But while Itto is a father and a husband, Lady Snow Blood, Yuki (or Oyuki) is a daughter who is \"cursed\" by her dying mother to avenge her family's tragic fate. \n I don't know which medium (movie or graphic novel version) of Lady Snowblood Quentin Tarantino drew inspiration from in his Kill Bill Vol.1, but you can see elements from the Kill Bill which are similar to what happened in Lady Snowblood, in particular, Kiddo's (Uma Thurman) kill list and O-ren Ishii's (Lucy Liu) tragic childhood. \n Lady Snowblood should be definitely in your list if you are looking for a classic adult manga. I haven't even discussed the stories which mirror Japan's dark side of 19th century politics and culture.",

        "text": "Although Crying Freeman is not at par with Kazuo Koike's obra maestra The Lone Wolf and Cub (god that series is just amazing), I throughly enjoyed reading this as a guilty pleasure material. \n Crying Freeman's protagonist is Yo Hinomura, a talented, kind and morally untarnished man who got into a series of unfortunate encounters with The 108 Dragons; and with acupuncture and training from really old people, he ultimately became the mafia's top assassin. But after each kill, he is filled with guilt and remorse, something that makes him cry, hence Crying Freeman. \n I said it is a guilty pleasure read. The material is filled with violence, sex and murder. The plot is what you expect from a mafia-assassin genre: kill contracts, love interest, training, murder and guns. Ryoichi Ikegami perfectly captures all these in his art style which is so detailed and alive. His drawings of cars, buildings and inanimate objects are exact and his characters are full of emotions. \n If you are looking for an adult manga about modern mafia and assassinations then look no more. Here's Crying Freeman.",

Sydney Padua's first collection of works about the steampunky and quirky duo sure is entertaining and humorous, but it really lacks a cohesive story that could have sustained my interest until the end. \n This comics (and almost a graphic novel) is the author's own interpretation of the life of Lovelace and Babbage, in a pocket universe where they have finished creating the Analytical Engine. This very premise topped with interesting foot and end notes and amazing artwork, oh I'm telling you the artwork alone is delicious to see, was unfortunately let down by the absence of a cohesive story. It is way far from a complete disappointment though, but I am a bit sad that so much material, well-researched documents and talent was seen in the book yet (almost hurts to sat this) it doesn't kept me reading it because there was no solid plot for them to keep going. \n I eventually finished reading it (comics plus the end notes) wishing that more could have been done to improve it.",

Drilon's other stories are obviously a product of a deranged beautiful mind which I genuinely meant as a compliment. Though his stories and art style may be varied, you can see inspirations from other materials and characters - Adventure Time, Preacher's Saint of Killers and Moore's Promethea are some of the works I have recognized aside from the obvious parody of Archie and Jughead. \n Kare-kare comics is faithful to its name, though it might be as well entitled as Chop Suey or Pinakbet comics.

        "text": "There is one fundamental flaw in how I approach reading Path of the Assassin. That is, whenever I deliberately do it or not, I always compare my reading experience with the Lone Wolf and Cub. Lone Wolf is perfect from start to end. There were no cringeworthy scenes and the information overload from japanese names is almost non-existent. Path of the Assassin is a different read. It is more of a chronicle of history, thus being historically accurate puts a leash on how Kazuo Koike builds the story. And Path of the Assassin just, unfolds. No thrill, no surprises and all. \n So to make my reading experience better in the last third of volumes, I must avoid comparisons and see Path of the Assassin as it is. \n I just do not know why there were a lot of unnecessary naked women in the series! That may be either a pervy move by the authors or a reflection of society, or both.",

        "text": "I'd be definitely lying if I say I didn't enjoy Infinite Kung Fu, because man, Infinite Kung Fu is tons and tons of fun! It is so incredible that Kagan McLeod packed so much fun in a tome so thick, densely drawn with the best movement and action illustration I have seen. Infinite Kung Fu is certainly on top in the fun department. \n McLeod doesn't also shy away from mashing-up different genres. Although Infinite Kung Fu is a straight-up martial arts comics that we have countlessly seen in 70s martial arts movies and from those Sunday afternoon Chinese Kung Fu TV, the material includes subgenres of zombie action, blaxpoitation and even a bit of steampunk (at which that wicked entrance of Charles at the climax part caught me by surprise). \n Infinite Kung Fu is best read when you are not thinking about it and just chomping on the graceful illustrations made by the author which truly embody what a big budget Hollywood-plus-Bruce Lee-esque martial arts movie would be if it is done in the graphic novel medium. There might be a bit of backstories and re-reading to do because of the abundance of characters, but thankfully the whole reading experience is not compromised by those names. \n Speaking of names, there's one I will not forget: Moog Joogular (play Isaac Hayes' Theme from Shaft here). He's the embodiment of funky groovy kung fu! May Buddha bless him! \n Now as I've said before, Infinite Kung Fu is best enjoyed as a mindless action graphic novel, because it is so brilliant and deliciously good in doing that. So with that said, I am pretty much surprised with the ending, disappointed even because all of a sudden, the philosophical and spiritual aspects of the book has suddenly taken the wheel and drove the story to a sudden, anti-climatic end. I honestly don't know what happened in the end. I just hoped that the end could have been fleshed out instead of being so abrupt.",

DKIII was too bad for its first four issues, and issue 5 was a huge improvement. \n If Capullo had drawn this, the issue would get a higher reading. Nope, Romita Jr's art isn't bad, it just takes a bit of time to adjust. But I too wish that some issue or issues would bring back the dynamic Snyder -Capullo duo. \n The writing style is no doubt Snyder's, with nice-to-know facts drizzled all over the pages. And I would love to see how he handles Two-Face and other Batman characters. \n Batman not in the dark Gotham is also a refreshing sight to see. Farm scenes and colors are usually associated with Superman so Batman literally out in the field is gonna be interesting. \n Duke is quite a charming character and I know he's going to do great things. His yellow palette costume with a helmet tells you that he is Robin and at the same time he's not. \n And yeah, I want to see what that enormous Batarang is for.",

That or you can say The Last Crusade is a direct prequel to A Death in the Family. \n Being a Miller story, TDKR beats are felt here and there in the comics but it can no way be at par with the TDKR story.

        "text": "First and foremost, Preacher did not end as I expected it to be. It has less violence and blood than the previous concluding arcs. The final setpiece is rather subdued and \"quiet\", save for a couple of explosions and gunshots. Though it is not the end I have expected, Garth Ennis has ended it in the best way Preacher could have possibly ended. And surprisingly, the ending has a heart and full of hope. Thus in a few words, I try to summarize what I felt about the ending, and please pardon my language: \n \"And they fuck*ng lived fuckin*ly happily ever after. So f*ck you and I love you, Preacher has ended.\" \n Alamo, the last volume is way more grounded and personal than the other volumes of Preacher. In fact, it is those personal grudges and motivations that drove all the main characters in doing what they ought to do. All the religious political BS and the \"confronting god\" thing for me just took a backseat in this last arc. \n If there is one negative thing I can add in this review, it was really Jesse Custer's plan. It may be brilliant and feasible from the preacher's point of view, but it is anti-climatic and a eenie-bit of a letdown from a reader's point of view. I mean, that has got to be the Jesse's main mission in the whole series, a sort of genesis versus god fight ala-Mortal Kombat right? \n As for the main series, Genesis really, really felt to be hugely underused and underdeveloped. The demon-angel lovechild didn't not really lived up to its full potential and the power of the Word being not as formidable and dangerous as it should have been. And what ultimately happened to Genesis was too convenient. Its fate was inevitable, but yet too convenient. \n Arseface's charm was felt until the conclusion of his story, but he could have been part of a larger scheme. But this is just nitpicking though. He is anyway the Hodor of the story. Herr Starr's fate was also inevitable, but Ennis made sure that it was helluva fun to see him being laughed at which is a sort of guilty pleasure feeling. The Saint of Killer's on the other hand got his dream of revenge fulfilled, though I doubt if the satisfaction will last forever. This kinda reminds me of Kratos. \n As for Jesse, Cass and Tulip, our three main characters, I will let you read what ultimately happened to them. \n For me, Preacher may not top the feeling I got from Scalped for a big chunk of the series but Ennis certainly nailed a better ending than Jason Aaron. It was funny as hell and a ridiculously fun trip, being with Jesse and co. Thank you Ennis, Fabry and Dillon for giving us such a great read!",

The first one gives a backstory to Reverend Custer while the second one gives us a glimpse of a super-secret society that has set all its eyes in finding the Reverend. \n As what I have said above, Preacher is a very offensive piece of graphic novel literature.

Ichiro, in its front is a Spirited Away-esque story of the eponymous character, who somehow \"fell\" in a hole Alice in Wonderland style. He met some of Japan's Shinto gods and the creatures of the spiritual world. \n During the time he spent there he have learned this war between the realms Ama and Yomi from the god of war himself, Hachiman. This war is obviously an allusion to the recent war the world have experienced, how it started, the lies fed to the people and its lasting effects. Although it passes as a good shinto story, and one may not relate it to the ones happening in the real world yet can still appreciate the material. \n The book has some racist remarks at the beginning which may raise some eyebrows. But it was also briefly seen that Ichiro and his mom, being Asians were also victims of it. \n The almost \"sumi\" art style is a great plus in the graphic novel. \n I understand why many dislike Ichiro though. The narrative is a bit clunky and disjointed at the start and one has to be invested in appreciating Shinto culture in order to get the most out of the book.",

In Trillium I do. \n Lemire has effectively built the setting and the overall mood of Trillum amd man, it is a nice canvass that begs to be filled-up with character and personality.

PEDK really shines when it tries to deliver the punchlines in a way that is organic to the young professional readers - those who are bombarded with daily political and social issues both in reality and the internet. Whereas Kikomachine caters to issues in the academe (enlistment, dorms, etc.), PEDK deals with traffic, spoilers and pop culture references along with other shit like that. \n The social commentary jokes range from lazily shallow to genuinely funny, and are my least favorite panels in the book (along with the 'babes' jokes). The presidential campaign jokes were just okay, given that the election was held already months ago. What I found most entertaining are the jokes about tv references, commuting and traffic, and unexpectedly the 'dad jokes'. \n PEDK doesn't care to be (mildly) offensive, blatantly bashing local personalities, ranting about events and the media. There are even pages dedicated to activists! \n P*cha e 'di Komiks appeals to those who are up to date with stuff in social media and those who experience the everyday struggles in the labor force.

The effective and brilliant color usage in black background has been replaced by 4-panel pages which, at many times, felt flat, random and uninspired (what happened, Rob?). \n In fairness with Lost, it still managed to deliver a sad story and a poignant tone at the end, hinting for a possible sequel. \n Rob Cham clearly experimented with Lost, from obviously digitally rendered backgrounds to the four panel comics with occasional fourth wall breaks to the computer-ish cloud creature. Sadly, these elements remove so much charm from Light. If there's going to be a trilogy, I hope Rob Cham goes back to what made Light special.",

Seriously man, what is the reason that you haven't read this Geoff Johns baby? \n I admit to all people, both young and old, that the New 52 has got me into reading superhero DC titles (which were limited to Alan Moore titles before that). It has then led me to collect a number of pre-new 52 titles, from Crises stories to Birthright to Animal Man etc. So whatever dogshit New 52 threw to the old world, it was clear that the reboot of fresh issue 1s gained the publisher new followers at the expense of so many fans who felt annoyed with the change. \n So I didn't know what the DC landscape was pre-New52. I have read a bunch of stories, but not really felt the whole picture. Now I'm starting to see. And my god, it was really, really way better than New52. So many things were lost! I felt almost guilty that I didn't bother reading such rich material. It was filled with ideals and hope. \n Now here comes DC Rebirth. It is funny that DC doesn't call it a reboot, but in fact it is a semi-reboot. Props to Geoff Johns though, because Rebirth is a restart which is done correctly. This made me research all the easter eggs. Wow. The things that DC are promising to its readers, I hope they do meet our expectations. \n Yes I said I cried. And this is coming from someone who is not emotionally invested with the narrator. But his return was so heartfelt and genuine. Why? Well it is more than the great artwork and crisp lines. It is because Rebirth is a love letter. DC basically admitted they messed up and now is saying sorry and promises to bring back the ones that were missing yet not destroying the new. The whole story is more grounded and not like previous reboots which are lavishly grandiose and overly ambitious. Rebirth hits your fragile emotions, like a Nicholas Sparks or a Korean family movie for comic book nerds. \n The villain reveal, oh yes! Personally (and what many feel as well), the story the villains came from is sacred ground in DC Universe and must not interact with the main DC superheroes. A big risk for them I may say. So DC better has to handle this seriously and carefully. But yes, I am extremely pumped-up to see how our DC superheroes will go against these group of baddies. \n Read Rebirth all of you. Okay? This is one helluva issue.",

Crazy, but you know, Japan. I live near a seaside city and I know the stench of fish and the putrid smell of rotten ones. Gyo gives me exactly that olfactory feeling of smelling such as I read through it. Props to Junji Ito for that. \n Perhaps my biggest complain is that Gyo ended abruptly as if the author just gave up. The resolution happened so fast from a hopeless aftermath to a sort of happy ending. \n There are bonus chapters in the end and I must say that the faultline chapter really, really gives me the creeps.",

No sir, this is not the hack-and-slash ones you can see at The Lone Wolf and Club. Rather, they are methodical and patient. \n There's a bit of scenes with Ieyasu and one of Oda Nobunaga's vassals. The conversation offers yet a glimpse into the relationship between the master Ieyasu and the servant Hanzo. Such a relationship, from another servant's point of view is genuine friendship. The vassal, Hideyoshi was in fact envious of such to the point that he questions his own decision of serving Nobunaga. \n There are still plenty of sex in this volume, and as Kato puts it, humping. Just saying.",

        "text": "If there is one thing Sex Criminals lack, that is story buildup. Now on its second volume, the series hasn't shown much criminal acts for Jon and Suzie to be called criminals. Instead, the whole fun of being almost gods with absolute freedom in the Quiet (or Cumworld) is quickly killed off by introducing the boring sex police right away. The Bonnie and Clyde of sex could have done a couple more heists! \n So Sex Criminals wasn't what I expected it to be, an R-rated heist comic turns out to be a story about two people with problems I don't care knowing. Please, enough of the past and overuse of flashbacks. Speaking of problems, Sex Criminals has the tendency to meander off the main story, filling so many pages with back stories of porn, dildos and sex. The story doesn't focus on one arc but instead is more involved in setting up the next one. \n If there is something which is consistent in the series, it is its sense of humor. Man, at least 87% of the book are jokes about the penis, the vagina, witty sexual innuendos and the list goes on. \n I'm still not yet a fan of the art. Usually it takes time for me to appreciate an artist's style, but this takes so long. I don't know, perhaps it is Jon's annoyingly large nose or Suzie's equally annoying large eyes (or Kegelface's, uhh, face) that make me feel distant and disinterested with the material. \n Much of what I said are personal preferences. An objective view of things will result to me saying that Sex Criminals is a recommended read. I cannot say that with all my heart though. Consider reading.other reviews and weigh in all possible thoughts before buying Sex Criminals.",

As a direct sequel to the previous part, I had to invest time rereading the first part of the ZZ trilogy as well as the original Zaturnnah graphic novel. \n What I can say is that the story is rich with new characters and several different subplots that I am excited to see being resolved in the last volume of the ZZ trilogy. ZZ2 offers some of the finest punchlines in the whole ZZ series. I also commend Carlo Vergara on the way he has handled such subplots and stich them together for a single cohesive story. \n Unfortunately, ZZ2 is the one I loved the least. The volume doesn't have any interesting villains like the Amazonistas of planet XXX.. Dialogue felt clunky and unorganized, something that hampered my appreciation toward the material. \n I'd still recommend that you grab a copy of this book.",

        "text": "While in the hospital, I read Uzumaki. This huge tome that collects all three volumes is the horror-child of Junji Ito. It has a twisted (no pun intended) imagery that is just so eerily beautiful to look at. What started as episodic and seemingly strange events that took place in the town of Kurouzo-cho became horrific mystery that involves the whole town. \n The first few chapters of this deluxe edition are full of promise and genuinely scary. With the spirals he drew, Junji Ito has effectively made the graphic novel medium into a true horror material. Uzumaki doesn't have any jumpscares because such are not effective in comics. Rather, these images give a strong psychological impression to its readers. I'm telling you, his spirals are both mesmerizing and scary to look at. \n Yes, I did say promising, because the whole series spiraled (now, pun is intended) from genuine horror to a mess of different things. It seemed like Junji Ito has lost most of his inspiration that made him start Uzumaki in the first place. It doesn't feel scary anymore. Perhaps it is the utter indifference of the people to the weird and supernatural events that are taking place in their town that turned me off or the shallow connection of objects which are supposed to be contaminated and scary just because they resemble a spiral (the spiral hairstyle, seriously?). The origin of the spiral phenomenon of the town has also been vaguely explained without offering any complete resolution. \n If there is one thing that is consistent all throughout the graphic novel is Junji Ito's drawing talent. There is always this giddy reader anticipation of what s/he will see next, a longing to see the next full-page panel will reveal. Uzumaki may not be the definitive horror manga you'll read but it is certainly on top of the list in this genre.",

This is therefore a sneak preview of what is yet to come. \n Now, when will the sex scenes stop (not that I am complaining)?

        "text": "This Sex Criminals has got to be one of the most interesting premise you could ever have in a story. It is a hybrid of adult fantasy, comedy and heist genres with a handful of fourth wall breaking. In Sex Criminals, a couple met and discovered that they are not alone in this planet with their powers that could literally stop time whenever they orgasm. Crazy, right? \n With sex jokes and pranks ranging from sexual innuendos, to crass dick jokes and to creating a total ruckus in a local porn shop, Sex Criminals is never really serious in storytelling. After all, orgasm-induced powers would make anyone think about the craziest and crappiest thoughts whenever they go into this so-called \"The Quiet\" or \"Cumworld\". \n With all the weird flashbacks and fourth-wall breaks that serve as devices to introduce our main characters, the main hest plot seemed to look very underwhelming. Although it is easy to be back on track whenever you lose your way in a deliberately loose narrative structure, the story altogether felt shallow and the characters, uni-dimensional. Well, at least I had a lot of fun reading it. \n I'm not really a fan of the illustrations though. That may have a significant effect on why I didn't like (nor hated) the characters. But I put it this way: maybe it will take a certain amount of time for me to be accustomed and finally appreciate the drawings. \n Sex Criminals may be worth your time, but there are definitely better material than this.",

We also see in this volume Saitama's gradual change of heart as he proclaimed that he is not a mere hero for fun, but now a professional hero. \n The extra chapters are also interesting to read (and surprisingly heartfelt).",

Such is my feeling with Path of the Assassin. Coming from Lone Wolf and Cub, Path definitely pales in comparison with the golden duo's (Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima) Lone Wolf series. \n But this doesn't mean that Path of the Assassin is no good. It is in fact another high-quality piece of graphic literature. The first volume has its own charms and like the young protagonists in the manga, has a tendency to be immature in certain subjects. Like there is too much sex amd nudity. \n The story is set in historic Japan, before the whole country is united by the Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa and way back from the events in the Lone Wolf. This is a story of a young master and a young ninja who serves him. \n Path of the Assassin has 15 volumes. I am still interested at how the story unfolds in the series.",

        "text": "Bravo! The golden duo, Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima has created a truly remarkable masterpiece not just in manga, but in literature as a whole. Let me just write this for the record: after reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez' creations, I have never thought I would feel this so much satisfaction again in reading. The Lone Wolf and Cub, in all its glorious 28 volumes definitely gives its readers a unique experience - a VIP trip to feudal Japan and front row set to the most exhilarating swordfights that ever graced the literary world. \n Why is it and how can be that Lone Wolf and Cub is that good, so good that it single-handedly increased my overall average rating here in GR by a handful of notches? There is no sole answer for that. The best and fastest answer I could give is that you have to experience it for yourself. Stop reading this text and go grab that first volume, read until the very last chapter of the last volume. By then you will understand what I am feeling. \n The Lone Wolf and Cub is waaaay more than a revenge story set in the Tokugawa era of Japan. It talks about so many things. It is a story between a father and his son who has to fight all those who come against them, be it ninjas, samurais and ronins, or the murderous weather. It is chock-full of assassination episodes where you won't tire seeing Itto Ogami carrying out such. It is also a highly political-historical work, where the hierarchy of Japan's government are embedded in the series' fictional political strife and scandals. Lone Wolf and Cub is both a tragedy and celebration of bushido, or \"the way of the samurai\". Tragedy because tons and tons of warriors have been killed following the code, with a significant amount of deaths were carried out by men and women who despise doing the kill, yet code adherence forces them to do so. This is also a celebration of bushido because there are so many characters in this series (including Itto Ogami and his arch-nemesis Retsudo Yagyu) whose actions reek of high respect to the code. It is also huge tome of religious references, from shinto belief, Buddhism, to meifumado, to poetic references to the stars, the wind, the wave. \n But above all, the whole manga is raved by its action. The artwork perfectly captures the swiftness in each stroke of the sword, the efficiency of the blade as a killing instrument and the bloodbath it leaves after the fight. The Lone Wolf and Cub after all is a fight between two true samurais. \n I have read Samurai Executioner and yet to read Path of the Assassin, both of which are works of the golden duo Koike and Kojima. All I can say is that Samurai Executioner, a great series nonetheless, pales in comparison with the Lone Wolf and Cub. The Lone Wolf and Cub has a special place in my reader heart. \n The last chapter, oh yeah. The series did not fail to surprise until the very last pages of the last chapter of the last volume. It is a perfect conclusion, after being so invested reading the story. It was worth all the time I have given in reading it. \n To Mr. Koike and (the late) Mr. Kojima, arigatou gozaimasu! You have my respect and admiration.",

On the other side of the blade is Ogami training Daigoro to become a sword fighter, entrusting him with the mission of his life. \n Yes! Three more volumes to go.

There is nothing so special with this, only some typical things you see in a Superman story: a villain brute, space aliens, a lot of Lois Lane doing a lot, the government, the DC trinity, Lex Luthor in the background and a lot of nuclear warheads. \n It clearly has Scott Snyder-isms like some lessons in mythology, a play with chemical terms that might or might not really exist and tons of expositions. This guy balances words with story and action in a tight rope, and manages to cross the endline entertainingly. Though I admit that Snyder is a Batman writer. \n On the art side, we do not have a problem as Jim Lee takes the pencils and drew the hell out of the comics, with all those expressions and muscles alike. The two might not be the best partners for a story, but thet did a passable job here. \n My gripe with Superman Unchained is that there is too much going on in the story. It is a mashup of so many things you might lose interest in one. I mean like, I just don't care about Ascension, because there are too much subplots that one won't be invested in all of them. \n I am yet to read a gpod Superman run in the New52, but so far the best thing I get is The Men of Tomorrow.

Things change and true motives start to show up as you read on and you realize that Ulysses is not another Superman at all. So I take it back, this blond long haired guy is not Superman 2.0 at all. \n The main story is a pretty much straightforward one - easy to read, easy to enjoy, easy to forget. The Machinist (or evil Iron Man, haha) serves his purpose as the villain who is just there, just because the story needs a villain. The other villains are there either for action or to start another story arc. \n The Super Flare superpower (as Batman names it) is a pretty cool power in terms of its scope and power, yet a kinda douche-y since it makes Supes human for a day. At least he gets to be 100% Clark for a couple of hours. \n Geoff Johns knew how to write a good story. I have read his GL run and his New 52 Aquaman, and this guy knows how to make the characters shine and what makes the heroes interesting to the readers. For Superman, he touches on themes about hope, humanity, family and friendship without getting too melodramatic about them. These are all the ideals of Superman that has become quite obsolete and underdeveloped in the New 52, so I'm happy that these otherwise corny themes are back.",

I believe that these standalone chapters are not vital to the whole Preacher story as a whole, though they offer a deeper character development that the main series didn't show. \n All three stories are entertaining, though it's only with the origin of The Saint of Killers and Arseface I am invested in. The background story about Jody and T.C., with all the satires and violence and its inappropriateness, falls flat and hollow when compared with the other two. \n Arseface's story before the ass face is a sweet, tragic comedy about a teenage kid who grew up everyday with everything going against him. I pity him and the sad state he is in now while laughing my arse off (pun intended) as I read his muffled dialogue shown in boxed translations. Whu wuhn hur whu huhmuh du wuh hu wuuh? (Who wouldn't try to imitate the way he speaks)? \n The Saint of Killers origin story on the other hand might pass as a straightforward revenge-western story with a lot of glorious bloodbath from gun-slinging and sabre-cutting, if not because of his brief trip to hell and encounter with the devil himself. Damn, this saint is clearly NOT someone to piss-off! \n Preacher volume 4 gives a quick detour from the main storyline.

Instead, Ogami did not take any life as an assassination assignment, yet still manages to leave a lot of dead bodies in his wake. \n The highlight of this volume is The Kyushu Road, where the Yagyu letter, a plot device that has never really developed since the all-out war of the Yagyu clan against the Lone Wolf has its secrets almost been revealed. \n The other chapters are as engaging as The Kyushu Road. There's even one chapter where Ogami Itto was never seen in any panel, and his involvement in the story is left for interpretation. Another chapter has something to do with an o-shichiri runner (they are sort of official messengers, samurais who can run pretty fast) and his unrelenting dedication to his task. Lastly, Christian Japanese who went hiding their true beliefs, those who are called Kirishitan were also given a story in this volume. \n One theme that I think is central to all the stories in this volume are the characters' reverence and obedience to the one they believe in. These beliefs, be it bushido, kirishitan or meifumado are more important than their lives. \n Now I am halfway towards the end of the whole Lone Wolf and Cub. It has been a great journey so far.",

        "text": "One-Punch Man starts to inject some drama in the series, and that is the gradual acceptance of the people, his peers in the Hero Association that Saitama is indeed a true hero. He still continues to prove to the readers that he is the One-Punch Man, capable of defeating his enemies with only one punch. Even though his enemies seem to get stronger and stronger, I don't want that central theme to change. \n Volume 5 gives the series some depth and soul without sacrificing the things which has been established in the previous volumes. Being the strongest puncher in the world doesn't mean Saitama has a VIP ticket in both rank promotion and crowd acceptance. After all, not everybody shares the same philosophy - he might be strong, yet some people still see him as a ruse. Though Saitama is a self-proclaimed hero for fun and someone who doesn't need any recognition, we begin to see that this charming bald protagonist is more than the yellow, white and red. He has a heart that hurts too. \n This fifth book also expands the ever-growing roster of diverse heroes, some we might never hear of again while some might stay in the story for a while. This gives space for ONE and Yusuke Murata some awesome \"filler action\" scenes that allow these heroes some time to shine. And that is actually good because the action sequences here are over-the-top awesome! \n One-Punch Man doesn't fail to entertain me. It is light, humorous, violent and definitely crazy.",

        "text": "\"Why Batman doesn't kill?\" and \"Who would win between Batman and Superman?\" are the two proverbial questions about our Caped Crusader. Answers to which are also in the comics, either through clever dialogue or unforgettable imagery. The first question is answered here in Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 2. \n Continuing both in tone and story, the second volume of Under the Hood ties up all the loose emotional strings between Bataman and Jason Todd, who was earlier revealed as the one called the Red Hood. This is clearly a definitive Red Hood origin story, both a culmination of the Jason Todd Death in the Family and commencement of the anti-hero Red Hood. \n Once again, Winick has effectively utilized unknown (at least for me) characters like Captain Nazi and the Hyena in some of the book's action scenes. Count Vertigo was also there, and I have read about him only at Green Arrow. This volume wraps the Black Mask story branch at the middle to give way to the most awkward reunion of all time: Batman, Jason Todd and the Joker. \n Then the throwdown of fists and philosophies happened between the Batman and the Red Hood. Specifically, Batman answers the question why he doesn't kill, even if the only one he has to kill is the Joker, THE Joker. The answer earned a respectable nod from me, though it is neither the most logical nor the answer which is the best one. But once I felt the gravity of Batman's answer, hell yeah, that's Batman right there. (Opinion: Now, this may be connected why people hate the killer Batffleck in Batman v Superman, but if you just try to understand what Bruce has gone into, plus other considerations, both the logical and rage-driven choice is to kill the Big Blue.) \n Under the Red Hood (which collects both volumes of Under the Hood) is a must-read modern-era Batman story. It is has well-balanced elements which are effectively executed to deliver a definitive origin of the Red Hood and an answer to Batman's no-kill policy.",

        "text": "Being a Batman comic fan who has read a number of Batman arcs, it is utter shame for me not to have read the Death in the Family storyline. All I knew was that Jason Todd who was then the Boy Wonder died at the hands of the Joker. So minus that, I've only read three Batman stories with him in it: Hush (he was kinda in it), Scott Snyder's New 52 Batman and this, Under the Hood. \n If there's one word I can say about this arc written by Judd Winick, it is balanced. Under the Hood Vol. 1 has the right amount of action, drama, dialogue and interesting characters that kept me engaged and entertained. Just to show you some comparison, with say Hush. Sure it was a great story with tons of action and interesting plot points. The problem is, it is saturated with so much characters that many of them were not really given the appropriate amount of screen time. It felt dense many times that Hush required a more focused reading than usual to fully absorb it. Under the Hood on the other hand unfolds itself in a more casual way, allowing the readers to sit back and slouch in couches while still enjoying reading it. \n Another thing I enjoyed with this volume is the way they have made use of lower-tiered/less known characters enjoyable to see, there's Amazo who is there for the actions, Onyx and Black Mask who was the story's one of the two main antagonists and comic relief. Oh yes, Under the Hood has a couple of funny moments, just enough to counter the emotional weight it carries. Such a weight becomes heavier at the end, where the sure, full of ego, calculated Batman starts to have feelings of doubt, and maybe even self-blame. \n Under the Hood is definitely the best Jason Todd story post-Death in the Family. If there is better than this, I would have known it.",

If the next volumes 11 to 14 will not be as explosive as this one, then I consider the tenth book as a mid-season finale for The Lone Wolf and Cub. \n The volume is not all bloodshed though. Daigoro stole the show with his own quiet chapters that further flesh out the emotions and personality of the innocent yet tragically broken child of the wolf. He may have a heart as strong as his father, but Daigoro's soul has been tainted by blood, violence and death that it has led him to trouble; yet as if fate and death plays with him, the cub manages to find love and compassion in his direst moments. \n Itto Ogami on the other hand may have reached his limit, that even though he may have god-like skills of a samurai (damn he is so good) the sheer number of enemies and the continuous wave of attacks have exhausted all of his power. \n But the true loser here is Retsudo (haha, shame on you bastard!), who has suffered heavy casualties.

In some sense, there is truth there, but this volume is not really aiming for greatness, it tries to be relatively more fun and energetic. Gordon Batman is not Wayne Batman, and I respect how Snyder treats the story with a lighter mood. Even Gordon himself facetiously shows this with his utter dislike with this idea of being the Batman. His meta-comments about how he hated this idea made me laugh! \n The villain Mr. Bloom is interesting, though he did not feel unique. Batman's rogue gallery is a mixed bunch of interesting characters, but Mr. Bloom doesn't fit very naturally in the group. I mean he is interesting, but it really felt that he is not someone we did not see before. \n There was one issue (44) that is very different from the rest of the issues in the volume.

Instead, we are given Kandorian terroristas who we do not really care about. Bigger scope does not mean a better story.

        "text": "The second installment of The Master Race certainly has good moments, but the almost bland story in this issue makes the whole work uninspired and forgettable. \n Carrie Kelly and Commissioner Yindel's conversation is the most interesting part of this book. The two have retained their core personalities in TDKR with Kelly just a tad serious and Yindel being humanized. The exchange of words is a battle of wits and I like how these supporting characters are given moments in the comics. \n In fact, this is an issue for supporting characters. Here we also see Lara (Supergirl) and Dr. Palmer (Atom) trying something for the benefit of the whole city of Kandor. I loved how things went down in that storyline and a setup for whatever action will happen in (most likely the middle of) the series. \n Oh yes, there are great splash panels. \n Mini-comic impression: The minicomic that accompanies this issue focuses on the mother-daughter relationship between Wonder Woman and Supergirl in a one-on-one training duel. Very ordinary.",

        "text": "The first book of Janus Silang was a blast. It truly embodied folklore with today's social media culture, resulting to a story which is definitely relatable to young Filipinos. Now there's a graphic novel version of it, so why not? \n Unfortunately, Ang Tiyanak ng Tabon graphic novel fails fundamentally in the style it has been drawn: manga. Now I do not, in any way hate the style itself, but to use it in Janus Silang takes away so much heart from the story. The manga-fied human characters felt so distant and the folklore creatures uninspired. \n Read Edgar Samar's 101 Kagila-gilalas na Nilalang. Now, the illustrations there are the ones that should have been in Ang Tiyanak ng Tabon! I feel disappointed with Anino comics with how they have handled the project. Sixty-six has a heart, Piko felt like a how it should be felt and Light is a short yet magical experience. This Janus Silang comics is a big letdown. \n In other elements, the pacing was just right. Some of the monologues and long expositions were due to the original material. The missed details and emotions are forgiveable, but again these should go unnoticed if the artwork enhanced the reader experience (Take Malonzo's Ang Subersibo as an example). Oh, there's the speech bubbles too. Why do they have to be unnecessarily big? \n Unless some improvement is done, I recommend to stick with the original material (JS2 is alreadu out as of the time of writing this review) and pass on this graphic novel version of Janus Silang.",

        "text": "Everybody admits that the whole Sandman Overture series is a beautiful piece of graphic literature, both in script and art. The most critical readers would indulge on how satisfying the series have concluded and how it seamlessly connected with the original classic. \n The series could have been longer though especially because many elements were left unexplained, leaving the core of the Overture bland and uninspired. With time not on Gaiman's hand (with months-long hiatuses between issues), the Overture digressed to quick fixes and hanging storylines. Yes, it could have been the limited number of issues, but pick any arc (which runs for about the same number of issues) in the original series and there's a mighty chance that it is better than the prequel. Gaiman could have made a smaller but more endearing and robust plot instead of taking a grandiose, superhero-ey story palette. \n Overall, the Sandman Overture is still a great piece of literature and one of the best series I have read in recent history. It is a huge triumph in artwork and dialogue, masking an otherwise easy and straightforward story.",

The reasons of the great war has never been explained except that it is a sort of event that is destined to happen for the whole universe to repair itself. Dream's way of solving it felt forced and so easy to think about. I think the art of JH Williams III tries to give this otherwise linear story some color and vibrance. This is not the original Sandman's Gaiman. \n There's also a surprising deus ex machina moment at the middle which sorts of eases the tension which I am invested at and worse, ruins the whole consequences of Dream's decisions. I simply did not expect a Neil Gaiman to use that! If not for the ending in this issue, it would be a drag for me to finish the whole prequel series.",

        "text": "Spoiler-free review: \n Dark Knight III The Master Race issue one is a great start to the last iteration of the Dark Knight trilogy. It clearly shows that Azzarello and Miller capture the charm of the critically-acclaimed DK I while still respecting the events that have happened in the atrociously bad DK II. \n Serving its purpose, issue 1 is mainly a setup chapter. It sets the tone and pacing of the series and uncovers some things that may have happened since the events of DK II. While the narration strongly reflects Miller's original series with pop-up news commentaries, DK III's flow is more of an Azzarello trademark - a right dose of darkness and grit, complemented by grounded (and bloody) action and modern narration. \n Fans of the original series may feel the deviation in art but given Miller's current state and the horrors of TDK Strikes Again, it is a good thing. \n Can this be read by those who have not yet read any of Miller's DK? By all means yes. The minimalist take in plot exposition and backstory makes issue one a perfect jump point to new readers. But it is best to read the two DK's first to be emotionally invested and make the most out of it. \n There's by the a way a mini-comics inside each issue. From what I have read in the mini-comics #1, it seems to flesh out stories which is unfit for the main issues but relevant enough to be read. I take it as a sort of repair plan to the mess DK II made. \n It may be too early to say if DK III is as age-defining as The Dark Knight Returns, but issue one definitely gives us a promising great ride.",

        "text": "If The Dark Knight Strikes Again is taken by the public as a cult, unorthodox, non-Batman and definitely non-mainstream story of our DC heroes, then DK2 might get into the positively-reviewed territory and become an unconventional cult classic. It is crazy, unordered, with so many wrong things in it. Hell, it is all wrong in the most explicit, boombastic and explosive ways. It defies the bounds of graphic literature. It may even be a topic for academic discourse and dissertations. \n But this is a mainstream Batman comic written by a well-respected writer which is a direct follow-up to an age-defining, best-selling The Dark Knight Returns. So all I can say is: WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST READ? \n Ohh, DK2 is wrong in all levels I can think of, in any dimension, story-wise and on technical elements. This is not even a Dark Knight story. It is a convoluted DC JSA-ish book. In each page, I wonder what the eff is going inside Frank Miller's mind. Is this a flick-of-a-finger joke to his fans and DC comics or did he simply lost his mind? The story is non-coherent and very poorly paced. Sure you'd know what is happening (not like Morrison's incomprehensible story-telling style) but your brain simply gives up. It is very, very poorly written. \n Second is art. Like what I have told a while ago, this would have created positive vibes when treated as an indie non-mainstream comic with its inconsistent art appreciated. But this is a DK sequel, it is supposed to be \"conventionally\" great to look at, orgasmic for comic nerds. I just cannot describe how bad the art is, it is just so bad, inconsistent, unclear and unprofessional. It is so bad that you appreciate some panels because of how bad they are drawn. \n Third is sexual objectification of women. Carrie Kelly is handled so poorly here. The nude women reporters are cringe-worthy and the Supes-WW sex (yes, they did the deed) is just awfully funny. This may be Miller's commentary to today's mass media and society as a whole, but it just failed, an epic fail. \n Lastly, Batman himself. The moment I started reading this, I asked: where is Batman? Where is this Batman who has created an army of teenaage vigilantes working in the dark, underground in Gotham? Oh he's there, in some pages, complaining, bitching around, being punched, drinking coffee, acting pseudo-badass and awkwardly-fatherly. He's acting un-Batmanly. Pity him. Supes, Carrie Kelly and even The Atom and Plastic Man even gets more action time than him. \n DK2 is wrong, it is a mistake. It is a joke. It might be Miller's way of delivering a punchline, but nobody laughs.",

It is a memoir which uses the graphic literature. \n This is my third read from an author of middle eastern origin (with the first two being A Thousand Splendid Suns and Habibi). While the book is largely an autobiographical account, it tackles so many elements of the social, political and cultural dimensions of the Iran, both Persian and Arab. Told of course in the perspective of Marjane, it delves inside and peeks in the life of women under the hijab and their fight against the oppression of women and the freedom of the country as a whole. \n Given first-hand experiences from the author itself, Persepolis accurately captures the Iranian way of life, with their struggles and how to deal with war and the aftermath of it. However, accurate portrayal doesn't mean a representative picture as the Satrapi family is an affluent one, so I can not extrapolate an \"ordinary\" household's way of life from the book. Though they may be rich (with her family being able to send her to Europe, away from all the conflict), they are very much politically involved, with relatives and friends being political prisoners, soldiers and martyrs. \n Persepolis has a heart but unfortunately it wasn't able to capture mine. It is innocent to a fault at certain parts, especially when the author was still a little girl, and brutally honest at other parts.",

        "text": "Now THIS is how you create a Filipino graphic novel. Ang Subersibo tells the story of the first two chapters of Jose Rizal's Noli Me Tangere, and right on the cover, you can see the amount of love and effort given to creating it. The face profiles of Ibarra (or Rizal?) and Simoun and the beautiful gothic calligraphy would really capture one's attention, not to mention the embossed geometric embellishments. \n Mervin Malonzo is the perfect illustrator for Ang Subersibo. He has proven his worth with his work in Tabi Po. I tell you, this guy can sure capture the feel of the Spanish-era Philippines. I love the jagged strokes he used in drawing the panels. But despite the staccato of pen lines, the pages are well-detailed. \n The prologue really gripped me especially with the first appearance of Simoun. From there on, nothing has stopped me from chomping this awesome literary material. The appendix on the other hand gave me an entertaining and educational behind the scenes on the development of this first volume. \n Albeit rather small, I love how the speech bubbles are used not only to deliver dialogue, but also to give more life to the bustling and crowded town. The interaction between the characters is drawn and written so well that one would know what each of their personalities are. \n Admittedly, I have never bothered reading Rizal's Noli and Fili, except for those times that I have to during high school (I know, shame!). Thanks to Ang Subersibo, it has given me the interest not just to follow the story from the graphic novels, but from the source material as well. I recommend Ang Subersibo to everybody.",

        "text": "What makes One-punch man different from any other manga is that though it still conforms with the general \"fight bad guys and make readers root for the protagonist since he is both cool and funny\" shonen manga, it has a lot of quirks and deviations that one can see it as a parody of the same medium it is written. \n For one, Saitama doesn't have that cheesy motivation, no Hokage dreams or finding my father kind of stuff. He's just an exaggeratingly strong guy who beats all his enemies with just one punch. So it is interesting to see how the series moves on without the drama of losing or the charm of the mantra \"I'm getting stronger after each fight\". Volume 2 pulls it off with funny antics and perfectly executed punchlines and two contrasting protagonists: we have Saitama and cyborg Genos. \n Violence is another key. Everybody knows Saitama is going to beat all with just one punch, so the sheer amount of violence in the illustrations help sustain the fun factor and thrill in the story. Second is variety. One-punch man's backstory is revealed rather gradually, but the calculated exposition and slow story development is filled with interesting characters. Last, there is humor. One-punch Man's jokes and funny antics are spot-on and effective. \n Volume 2 continues to be great, if not better than the debut volume. It is funny even for my age, violent and different. I'm a fan now.",

        "text": "This is the book that will make you shout to everybody else and say \"hey I've read this, and it is totally, explosively perfect!\". \n A Lone Wolf chapter with the Yagyu clan in it is 10 times more awesome than an ordinary Lone Wolf chapter. Now, a chapter with Retsudo in it is even a hundred times more awesome than an ordinary Yagyu chapter. That chapter folks, is Dragnet. That first panel of Dragnet with Lord Retsudo's looking samurai-badass has got to be one of the best illustrations of the whole Lone Wolf series. Seriously, Goseki Kojima must be a god to draw something that flawless. \n The other chapters are in no way inferior to The Lone Wolf's painfully high standards. One chapter worthy of being mentioned as well is Cloud Dragon, Wind Tiger (haha, familiar). The emotions in the duel of the two ronins is too much for me to handle. The action scenes with the sword-wielding horsemen is perfectly executed. \n I'm happy to see Daigoro's character to be fleshed out in this volume. Sure he's curious as a kid, but he's as tough as a man. Daigoro truly has a heart of a true samurai while still being innocent as a child. \n Balanced with well-written story and perfect illustrations, this Lone Wolf and Cub volume is the best ever volume I have read. And there are 21 more books to go. Holy dotanuki.",

        "text": "I'm reviewing this last chapter alone, since I would have rated the whole series with a glorious five stars. Volume 9's end promised a vague foreboding of what is to come, that for those who knew Asaemon in The Lone Wolf and Cub, would certainly feel that at least things will wrap up in the tenth volume. \n I may have interpreted it mistakenly because nothing big really happened in volume ten. Even references to what will become of him in the future are not found anywhere. It is just, like the previous ones, a compilation of standalone stories that require only a light backstory knowledge to appreciate them. For someone like me who have been emotionally invested in the story, this is a big letdown. \n My rating bears much more on my personal expectations than the material quality itself (though I can argue that writer and artist fatigue is apparent in the last two volumes). The cultural and historical details are accurately depicted in the whole series. The characters are depicted as deep and not shallow, thanks to Koike's impeccable writing and Kojima's absurdly fantastic art. \n Another gripe that I have on this volume is the extended screen time of Kasajiro and Shinko the Kappa because they felt as filler issues, especially with this being the last volume.",

It tells an unconventional crime story that combines elements of romance, booze and drugs and innocence. \n The trademark dark hues and excellent shadows of Criminal art is juxtaposed with simpler illustrations. Hence the art does not only set the mood for the grim and noir overall tone as what it has always been in the series, but effectively contrasts Riley's (the protagonist) immaturely innocent past and the mess he has become in the present. \n Last of the Innocent may be set in Brubaker's Criminal world, but it departs from the typical motivations and perspectives seen in the previous arcs. Connections with other Criminal books are scattered in bits and pieces throughout the story so one would know it happened in the same place as the others stories. \n The ending may feel too conveniently easy and happy but that itself gave me a subtle feeling of uneasiness, that things will ultimately go south. So that \"things went all too well\" at the end is a fitting conclusion.",

I'm used to human assassinations and killings in the series, but murdering dogs? Oh man that's cruel. Effective, yes, because the hatred I felt was completely captured in Daigoro's deathstare of pure bloodlust that I wish he could have personally killed the scumbag dog murderer. \n Then there's the one-page panels and two-page spreads of Goseki Kojima which blew me away!

Preacher is pretty sick and violent. Garth Ennis made sure that readers of his work will constantly be fed with blood and black humour. \n Preacher is dark. Funny and genius, but dark. Thus it is not intended for mature readers alone, but mature readers who will keep an open mind, be hardly offended and will regard the material only as an entertainment piece. Because the darkness in Preacher is offensive, sometimes racist and definitely not for the squeamish. \n So, taken as a literary work, Preacher is downright entertaining. I mean seriously, arseface? Ennis is crazy and sick enough to name one of his characters arseface. Well, not to mention the deaths made by only one man, the Saint of Killers. The concept of Genesis itself is just wild. \n Kudos to Steve Dillin with his detailed art. The grit and dark humour is perfectly reflected in the grins and skin wrinkles of the characters he draw. There's a certain beauty in how he draws torn skin. \n To anyone who has read Vaughan's Saga and Y The Last Man, there are several similarities between his works and Ennis' Preacher, although just in bits and pieces since these three stories are in no way the same. For one, the angel and demon thing in Preacher is like Saga's Landfall people and the Wreath moonies. The interstate progression of Y The Last Man is similar with that of Preacher's. \n Preacher has 9 volumes, so, eight more to go.",

I can neither root for nor relate to any character. Their individual decisions felt rushed and done only to conveniently advance the story and give Black Science more action sequences. \n The characters are inconsistent and have ever-changing personalities, shallow assholes IMO who deserve to be trapped in some reality of the onion. \n Black Science is supposed to be rich and deep, considering the main premise is to explore new worlds and go deeper in the onion. Like the characters themselves, the worlds seem to be just alternate realities of our own, not offering something more deep and unique. \n Fix it please.",

Nonetheless, newcomers to this rich world will enjoy reading it as well. Gaiman has brought back just enough characters in issue 1 to bring nostalgia to Sandman fans but not too crowded for new readers to appreciate. The Sandman characters are, as they have always been, timeless and unchanged. \n Much credit should also be given to JH Williams. I have seen his works in Promethea and Batwoman. Gaiman and Williams is the perfect team to pull this project off. \n Since Overture runs only in six issues, you'd feel right away the faster pacing of the story, so the creative team has put so much beauty in every page.

These were the times when we were still curious about new things and caught cold-sweat in a dilemma on whether or not to explore certain, uhh \"activities\". Itch neither tells a moral story nor seeks to be discussed in academic discourse (In short, it is neither hypocritical nor pretentious). It is just there, humbly telling you Aya Estrada's story which you have very likely experienced in your early teenage life. If you succumbed to such hedonistic tendencies or be adamant enough to uphold culture and school-induced moralities, either way, it's okay. You're cool. You're normal. \n I love the escalating curiosity and the sustained tension in the story. Itch is like a matured introverted shy nerdy rebel who is bold enough to face the ghost of pleasure past with a sucker punch and a pie to the face. Though it is clearly intended for the female audience, I am certain that Itch can also invoke counterpart memories in us guys, memories during those times when we were still young to fully comprehend changes happening around us. \n So yeah, Itch is a must-read. It gives you Pantheon books-ish feels. I hope that the author will create a follow-up story on this.",

        "text": "Batman Night Cries is more of a social revelation of the secret horrors happening in families than a Batman story. Often a core element in a Batman story, the detective work here merely serves as a plot advancing mechanism rather than a core frontrunner. The story builds up to a truth that hits you hard at the homestrech and ends on a sad note. \n Batman is able to bring down even the gods of fiction. He can easily take down mafias and regular crimes on the streets of Gotham. But in Night Cries, Batman painfully recognizes the sad fact that eradicating child abuse, a silent and real villain, is an insurmountable task. It is the monster that even him and Commissioner Gordon cannot escape from. \n The Dark Knight is the perfect comicbook hero to craft the story with. He works in the street at night, he's human and grounded. The dark and and horrifying truth flawlessly blends with his tragic past. Thus the result is an effective delivery of message which does not feel contrived. \n Illustrator Scott Hampton's style gives the book an authentic darkness and a tragic feel. The emotions and innocence of the abused are captured spot-on, with some panels really hard to stomach. \n For most parts, writer Archie Goodwin's writing is good. The pacing is right, allowing tension and mystery to be felt by the readers. He writes a shitty world that even Bats could not clean himself. His style though is a bit clunky. I have to backread some pages just to know whose character narration I am currently reading. Some of the dialogues also felt unnatural. \n Although Night Cries is not one of Batman's best stories, this one has to be in every Batman reader's library for its social relevance.",

        "text": "Endgame is a fitting conclusion to Snyder and Capullo's Batman ever since they have started writing the New 52 Caped Crusader. This arc imnortalizes Snyder as one of the best Batman writers. \n There are so many elements in Endgame that I don't really know where to start. Well, it is a Batman vs Joker story but it is way more than that. This is a legendary story, a modern myth and as they put it, an epic drama of comedy and tragedy. Endgame is a masterpiece. \n I won't spoil anything on who won but to tell you frankly, I also felt uncertain that Bats would be able to pull it through. The stakes are real. Batman for the first time is at a loss and doesn't have a concrete plan while Joker has gone serious about killing him. \n As you progress towards the over-the-top brutal climax, Endgame lets you experience things that lays the foundation of Batman: who wins between Batman and Superman? Does he has a chance against the Justice League? What really is the Batman-Joker relationship? The League is there, the Batman family and rogues gallery are there, the whole Gotham is involved, the Snyder created Court of Owls were also present. Endgame also leaves you with more questions and lingering thoughts. Snyder has left details which are open for interpretation. \n Endgame is the ultimate Batman fan service comic. One has to be emotionally invested to maximize the reading experience - meaning you have to start reading from the Court of Owls arc to the Death of the Family then Zero Year. Endgame is there in top tier of Bat-stories, together with The Dark Knight Returns, Year One and The Killing Joke. That's how good it is.",

Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima are meant for each other in creating this masterpiece. \n Lone Wolf's son Daigoro also proves to be a capable ally (in a cunning way) instead of just being an accessory to his father's Meifumado or path towards hell. \n The violence here is outrageously poetic with samurai stances bringing chill to my spine and joy to my craving for action scenes. Kojima's cinematic illustrations really give the manga its authentic Japanese feel. There may be some scenes here where women are portrayed as sex objects, and I think it will persist throughout the story but they are nonetheless strong and as strong as men. \n I really love reading Lone Wolf and Cub.

The first two chapters alone set the tone of the book and establish the protagonist as a samurai worthy of testing the shogun's swords as an executioner. \n Whereas Ogami Itto is more of an antihero ronin hell-bent on revenge, Asaemon's heart is a perfect model on discerning right from wrong, infallible yet hellishly brutal. Do not ever mess with this person, for he will not hesitate to decapitate you faster than a blink of an eye! \n So yes, there are lots of decapitations in Samurai Executioner. Unlike Lone Wolf, Asa is more of a passive warriror, with scenes relatively tamer than Itto's. But I know that both of them are equals. Being just an executioner no way makes the story boring. \n I'm also totally in love with the artwork, which perfectly reflects Japan in its shogunate era. Kojima's details are hauntingly realistic and expressive. \n Samurai Executioner is a treasure. If you manage to get hold of this magnificent series, do not ever hesitate, read it.",

Kurt Busiek has done a mesmerizing job on carefully placing human emotions - awe, fear, ignorance and hatred effectively across the progression of the story. This is a graphic novel where great feats and epic battles only give auxiliary aesthetics to the main thesis: what would we do when \"they\" come to this world? \n Though rich with Marvel gallery of heroes and villains, it doesn't feel convoluted. Bits and pieces of them are carefully scattered throughout the book, both on and off panels. Some can be seen longer than the others, like the Fantastic 4 but all of them do get an enough amount of screen time to be appreciated by readers. \n Marvels is a one of a kind story that has beautiful art (thanks Alex Ross!) and a heart of every normal person.",

        "text": "Something is fundamentally wrong with East of West. This alternate-universe story of the end of times may be full of awe with its grandiose artwork worthy of reverence, rivaling Vaughan's Saga and Y: The Last Man. Unfortunately, East of West messes up with one rudimentary element in a what would have been an excellent material: character personality. \n Critically-acclaimed graphic novel runs like Aaron's Scalped, Gaiman's Sandman and Koike's Lone Wolf and Cub have characters having the most interesting personalities and unique voices. No matter how much you hate or love what they do, you'd instantly know that they are acting according to their persona. Now, East of West has all the interesting characters but somehow, Hickman fails to give his characters that required distinctness. For example, badass as he may be, Death doesn't have a unique voice. It felt that Death as the story's protagonist could be replaced by one of the three cringeworthingly lame Horsemen (I hate these guys!). That is the fundamental flaw in East of West: the set pieces and amazing plot paves the writer to create colorful characters but fails to do so. I mean John Freeman I may be very different from the other Chosen, but he is too shallow to be unique at the level of becoming interesting. Crow and Wolf are two more badasses in the story but they could have been replaced by two equally badass characters. A unique character voice made Sandman's endless and Narutos's Jinchurikis unforgettable. \n To be fair, plot advances in this second volume gets more steam than the previous one. The flashbacks and back stories are entertaining to read. Death's action sequences are way more satisfying in this volume than the previous one. \n On a more personal point of view, I hate \"Oh yes, I know the future but not all of it, so figure it yourself\" cliche. This plot advancement device has been used over and over whenever there is a prophecy involved. Could someone (aside from Alan Moore, because he masterfully wrote an omniscient Dr. Manhattan) write a story with an efficient Oracle, please? \n I'll keep on reading East of West.",

I particularly hoped to read more of the action-carnage scenes (you'd know what I'm talking about when you read the material) but what I got more are dialogues and the three Horsemen trying to find Death. Curse these three horsemen. Why? Famine, Conquest and War are abysmally generic and annoyingly dull! Death is a tad better but generally unlikeable too. While a certified badass, I seriously don't buy his \"I will do everything for love\" motivation. It just felt cheesy and forced.

President Chamberlain is worth reading for and the Crown Prince of Orleans looks cool.",

        "text": "There are two reasons why I bought (the Meganon comics edition of) Gwapoman 2000 Unang Libro. First is that it is written and illustrated by Aaron Felizmenio, whose artistic style in Minkowski Space Opera truly awed me. The second reason is this particular edition's cover, though not the one displayed here in Goodreads looks badass! It is reminiscent of another badass illustrator, Ashley Wood, the one who is responsible for the dark art of Metal Gear Solid. \n Those are the only things good about Gwapoman 2000 because the content doesn't have anything good to offer. Felizmenio's artistic craft is promising but inconsistent that it truly affects the reader's appreciation towards the material. Although that is fairly understandable since this is a collected edition where the author have written the chapters at different times. \n What is worse is that Ang Huling Baraha has a very incoherent plot that I kept on extrapolating what is really happening in the panels. From what I have read, this kid Alas frees a veteran vigilante-ish Gwapoman and later teams up with him to do a particular mission, only to find someone else - Margaux. I may be totally wrong here mind you! The abuse of flashbacks makes the story too convoluted to follow. The chapters are too disjointed you might think that Felizmenio only wrote what random adventure he has in mind. \n The writing is as bad as how the story is told. The dialogues are uninspired and rife with loopholes, contributing to the lack of cohesiveness in the story. There are times that the script is too random that I didn't bother understanding it. You feel that Felizmenio tries to give unique voices to each character but he fails to do so unfortunatey. The narrative boxes reflect his shot at doing prose but they are shallow and empty. For someone who has much potential as Aaron Felizmenio, he really needs a writer partner. \n And I have not said the worst thing in Gwapoman 2000: it is lack of editing. I just wonder HOW the material got published with all the misspelled words, grammatical errors and overlooked typos. Lame and shameful. \n I still earnestly urge you to buy this book though because personally, I never abandoned my trust with the local indie komiks industry. And from our support they can improve their craft.",

        "text": "Light, with its obvious inspirations from Bone (but without words), bit of Adventure Time and dungeon-cave fantasy RPGs coupled with Rob Cham's art in pitch black background gives this little book its own unique charm. \n Light's nameless protagonist travels to a cave, among other places for a mission which is not yet revealed until near a halfway read, from which the result of a successful quest is not revealed until the very end of the book. Thus the story itself is a template of most role playing games and fantasy stories, though much condensed in Light, so you have to experience everything until the end where the challenge of the whole mission is reconciled with the worthiness of the reward. \n But since Light is well, a light and short read, the otherwise formidable foes don't get too much screen time to convey the true challenge they pose to our protagonist. It just felt like this Bone-y character casually walked through the whole ordeal, killing much of the thrill. \n I cannot complain too much though, because Light has downright gorgeous art. It is full of childish whim and fantastic creatures you'll enjoy browsing through it over and over. \n Anino Comics seems to be making its comback after its successful wave of Arnold Arre era comics. Hopefully we see more quality graphic works from this publisher.",

        "text": "Sixty-six volume 1 gives a proper and grounded introduction to the protagonist, Mang Tino, who in his old age has mysteriously acquired superhuman strength. This four issue collected edition chronicles Tino's initial adventures interspersed with his daily responsibilities as a caring husband. \n An old man who can singlehandedly throw trucks? Awesome idea. But the main thesis of \"what can an old superman do\" seemed to be underutilized throughout the story. This can be mainly attributed to the lack of character depth. While the panels with his wife Aura felt sincere and while Tino's conversations with the trusty tanod are entertaining enough to make you smile, their monotonic roles bored me. Worse, it took toll on Tino's character in a sense that the lack of character depth can make one feel that the main hero could be just anyone. At least the cliffhanger end provided promising fates for these two supporting characters. \n It is good that the main antagonist after this prologue volume is still more shrouded than exposed, and I can't wait to see how this group is connected with Mang Tino's discovery of his own superhuman strength. \n The cliched superhero moments are forgiveable because of the smooth execution and often hilarious ways they are seen in the panels. One can obviously see some Batman and Spidey elements in the book (where I love the 90s action Eddie Garcia-ish vigilante style but absolutely hate the New York Yankees cap). Ian Sta. Maria has clearly improved the cinematic appeal of his work since his Skyworld days. \n Sixty-six is worth reading, especially for those who are into the local comics theatre. It may not be at par with Mervin's Tabi Po and Gerry's Elmer, but this read is certainly better than Maktan 1521 or Alanguilan-Arre's unbelievably bad Rodski Patotski.",

I would have given this an extra star if we were living in the 90s. The crossover formula which was executed in DC vs Marvel doesn't work now except for giving readers a feeling of nostalgia. \n DC vs Marvel is a recommended read for all superhero-loving people.

Definitely, this Wonder Woman run is more than just an absolute classic, this is a modern mythology story - a story of gods and warriors and olympian battles, at par with the mythos of Greek literature. \n Azzarello's Wonder Woman run ends in an anti-climactic fashion, but still it ended great. \n Next to its very brilliant story is Wonder Woman herself. Azzarello has truly captured her persona. He is able to bring out different sides of her with perfect timing and execution. There she is being a god and queen of the amazons while loving even the most vile of all evils. You can feel her genuine compassion on one panel while still experiencing how strong she could be. She truly embodies the wonder in a woman. \n I really love how Azzarello wrote Wonder Woman. It revolved around family in home. There's no Justice League, no Cheetah, no Steve Trevor. This is a story of Diana in her roots - with her family of amazons in Paradise Island and her crazy Olympian bloodfolk. \n Sadly, oh sadly, this ends BA and Cliff Chiang's 3-year stint.

        "text": "Okay, something huge happened in this volume. I won't spoil it to you guys! \n Chew Chew Chew, why are you always fun to read? With six volumes, you have never failed to bore me and volume 6 may be the funniest of them all! And it may be the most lighthearted as well, given that Toni (Tony's twin sister) steps up the stage as the main character in this volume. Toni's personality is genuinely golden and lighthearted and I love the way she is utterly happy with her powers as compared with Tony's (not to blame him in fairness) sometimes total disgust with what he can do. \n The totally huge thing happened right after the page with this panel. \n Poyo is a clear winner in this volume. He has his own special issue where he trashed Satan and all his minions! That, my friends is a craaaazy pitch-perfect badassery. \n I love all the small funny details in this volume - the background wrtitings, photos and implied jokes really crack me up. Keep them coming!",

That sportswriter finally had his (almost) revenge with our charming cibopath as he forces loads and loads of anciently rotten baseball players to Tony just to write a book about their sexual escapades. Haha, as if Chew isn't weird already. \n Yet I quite get the feeling that this particular volume is just a filler arc. The baseball story just provides a perfect leeway for Olive Chu character to develop, and John Layman has carefully changed her from a quiet emo kid to a very likeable protagonist. I am so interested with what Olive can do given what she has shown here. \n Chew has been consistently fun and over-the-top weirdly funny. There is literally no limit to what John Layman can do in the series.",

Immediately starting from where Isyu 1 ended, this Mervin Malonzo masterpiece is a careful craft of alternate fiction that delivers a devastatingly delicious amount of artsy gore and cinematic sketches. \n Yes, Isyu 2 never dwindles down in terms of quality. Instead, narration and plot development take the front seat as they seamlessly blend with colonial era bayan. Mervin Malonzo has proven himself to be a talented writer as well. He's able to write a well-paced story that balances dialogue with panel art. \n The inks are as great as last time, with the dominant vintage warm tones with sprays of midnight blue (the starlight scenes are perfectly handled) and sprinkles and gashes of blood red. \n The only issue I have was that I have almost cringed with Isyu 2's seemingly unnecessary rape scene (because why?); But after things turned out, I'm fine with it. \n Tabi Po Isyu 2, like the previous one is another winner for me.

This action-packed volume has a disjointed story and clunky dialogue - two big letdowns from otherwise awesome action panels. Black Science volume 2 largely happens in only one universe. The formula is still there: a f*cked-up universe where the characters get into trouble and all of them must manage to be near the pillar at the exact time it (randomly) jumps. \n Grant is neither likeable nor relatable, same with Kadir. In fact, all of the characters are just the shell of who they were in the first volume. I don't buy Kadir's sudden change of heart, now the Shaman's motivation to protect the Pillar (although that cyborg Shaman needs more screen time in my opinion). \n From a possible classic, Black Science has sadly turned into a forgettable story. It has so many promising elements in the previous volume that has been underutilized in volume two.",

Blacksad is a gem of the comics medium, but instead of being loud and boombastic like the saturated superhero comics, this one has found its smoke-filled home in a bar lounge of 50s music. \n Reading Blacksad is like reading a movie full of deceit, scandals, controversies, discrimination and other political issues. Here we join Blacksad and sometimes his comical sidekick Weekly in their quest to uncover the truth by finding clues, visiting people and a healthy dose of mano a mano fights. Oh I assure you, a cat versus croc fight is a messy sight worth seeing. \n The collected book of four Blacksad issues is undoubtedly a series of noir crime stories. There are elements of Sin City, LA Noire, The Triplets of Belleville here. The artwort is insanely detailed and the animal facial expressions are spot-on. \n Blacksad is a truly unique and fantastic comic.

        "text": "Maktan 1521 in National Bookstore? Why not?! \n Tepai Pascual's cinematic art style in Maktan 1521, though heavily influenced by anime is commendable. The aesthetic details and colorful costume designs contrasted with mostly dark toned panels are perfect for the bloodbath fight scenes and stealth stories. Tepai Pascual's panels are undeniably great to look at. She is truly an artist. \n That is where the problem starts. Although admittedly her fine arts undergraduate degree thesis, it is perfectly understandable that the material itself weighs heavily in artwork. But personally, before publishing, one should have created a killer story, right? Maktan 1521 unfortunately settles with good artwork and a shitty story. \n Please don't get me wrong here but Maktan 1521 is deeply flawed. The story is so generic and sometimes disjointed you cannot root for any of the characters in the story. You can even say that it is a rehashed 300 graphic novel with Shikamaru in it. What I am pointing out is that it is a mash-up of influences and is filled with war movie cliches. It lacks the originality that Lapu-lapu deserves. \n What is unforgiveable in Maktan 1521 though are the speech bubbles. Very, very horrible speech bubbles. Now, some may cringe on what I have said but some will also understand why. \n I cannot really not compare this with Mervin Malonzo's Tabi Po. If you get the chance to see both of these and you only have to choose one, always go with Tabi Po. Both are equally beautiful artwise with Pascual winning on action and movement, but Malonzo's style is so original that you'd certainly feel (and smell) history and the past. \n Tepai Pascual is one of the best artists I have seen in our present local comics industry, partnered with a brilliant storyteller, they may deliver the best stories the graphic novel medium can give.",

It is always a thrill to see what world they have jumped into and the amount of time they have to spend in that place oftentimes keeps me at the edge of my seat. \n This gives Remender and his team to be absolutely free of the worlds they are creating, which is I believe the selling point of Black Science. It will never be not fresh and you will never know what will happen next. \n But it does not mean that the story is a convoluted mess, it manages to deliver a serviceable yet believable motivation that the readers symphatize: the characters have to go back home. \n This sci-fi drama is a graphic material which is worthy to read, although it is not as great and epic as Star Wars, Black Science is a classic in the making in the universe of sci-fi drama themed stories.",

It has so much drama and emotion that you feel like you are watching an Emmy Award-winning series (oh please make the series happen).

This is where I also appreciate Guera's work more than Aaron's story. \n This volume's quiet when it comes to exposition though.

You know that there is a part of you in this graphic novella - perhaps a bittersweet memory or a lifetime of wishful thinking. \n I first read this Arnold Arre creation more than a decade ago, and I did not even bother to appreciate it. Maybe I was young and too innocent. Maybe I wasn't hurt before. But reading this in 2014 gave me so much feels of my past! Trip to Tagaytay is full of 90s references that I can really feel the Eraserheads songs and my elementary days. It fully embodies what a throwback really is, which is a past you really miss once you see something that reminds you of it. \n The facial expressions. Oh yes, the sadness and yearning is in there. This is what I was telling about in my other Arre review na wala na ngayon (ehem Patotski). \n There is not much of a story though. There are little backstories here and there but that would be the most you can get. Trip to Tagaytay is yes, a trip. \n If you happen to see an original or a reprint of this classic piece.

Pre-N52 really comes strong in impeding the greatness in the stories of the New 52. \n Forever Evil talks big about what the New 52 is all about. Evil is relative. There is no good good and there is no really bad evil. But this doesn't take the fun out of the comic story. It is injected with the right amount of humor and humanity that will entertain and appeal for a very, very wide audience. The story is solid, the exposition doesn't hinder the entertainment factor and the ending is both surprising and nostalgic. \n Here, you also see Johns' maturity in storytelling. And the evolution from the Blackest Nights and Brightest Days to Infinite Crisis to Throne of Atlantis to Forever Evil is apparent. On a technical standpoint, Johns can beautifully serve a plate of a thousand-ingredient dish. It is an uncanny talent that only a few can master. Geoff Johns is a perfect superhero writer. Vaughan is a virtuoso in story writing and execution, Morisson is a genius of crazy ideas, but when it comes to boom-boom-pow epic superhero stories, it's gonna be Geoff Johns.",

It was less than a page short, but very powerful. \n Then the other one needs no explanation at all besides Saying that it is violently cool: POYO. \n POYO!! \n Just Desserts ended with a cliffhanger in its happy thanksgiving day issue. It is also here that a minor revelation is perfectly done.",

        "text": "If Chew volume 1 is the seed, Chew volume 2: International Flavor is a teenage plant with its branches still in their youth already forming and in time, ready to bear fruit for us to feast on. \n The second volume escalates from the previous one as it intertwines the different plots that will develop in the successive story arcs. I wonder how Layman gets these utterly crazy ideas and mix them to concoct an even crazier story. What's more is that he patches these plot previews in a neat and clear manner that you don't have to go backtracking for something you might have missed. You don't have to sacrifice relishing the rowdiness and action just to remember what is really happening. \n FDA Agents Tony Chu and John Colby. \n Volume 2's icing on a delicious done cake is the return of Chu's original partner, John Colby. Agent Colby may not be on at Yamapalu island where the main setting of the story arc is, but his new abilities and unexpected personality reveal paints the sophomore installment with charm.",

Hence, there is no point of comparison. With all the hype in this issue when it was launched, Outcast #1 is a serviceable and mildly entertaining piece of reading. Kirkman's script is not as solid as Aaron or Ennis, but the world he builds is really worth checking \n The art, save for the colors and some genuinely scary moments takes some time before you can appreciate it. Character facial expressions are not really spot on. \n I also notice that Outcast relies on cliches and references you have already seen somewhere. One example is the mouth-to-mouth vomiting we have seen in one horror movie. Demon hates light. But overall, I am pretty much interested with what Robert Kirkman sets up in Outcast. Now in its 28th issue, I still have a long way to go.",

After reading this volume which collects the first five issues of the series, I am craving for more Chew. \n Meet Tony Chew, a Cibopathic detective who gets psychic impressions from whatever he eats. Neat huh? NO. Imagine what would he do, as a detective, to solve a crime. Eat rotten fingers? Hahaha, I spoiled it for you (uhh, pun intended). \n Stomach-churning hilarity. Please, get over your squeamish self and read this. \n Taster's choice is a fitting first arc of a story. The main characters are introduced. With exposition limited to hilarious one page introductions and prologues, John Layman lets them characters play unrestrained for the rest of the story. There are also some references for future plots here and there and the plot-changer at the last issue makes me crave for more of Chew. \n Crave for more. Some of the panels are downright disgusting so I recommend not to read this before or after meal times. \n Rob Guillory's cartoonish style complements Layman's often zany writing and those frequently-occurring riotous scenes. \n Read this and you'll be wanting for more Chew servings.",

He made me walk like a robot and turn my head like a robot and make metal sounds like a robot. I can still remember flashes of RoboCop using his jetpack. This very comic collection brings back that childhood memory. \n Oh yeah, RoboCop. \n RoboCop versus The Terminator has so much 90's feels in it! Heavy, dark narration, lens flares on heroic poses, and high-contrast color palette. RoboCop versus The Terminator is a testament on how entertainingly fun 90's sci-fi action was. It is a visual spectacle. The shallowness of the story and the amount of cinematic scenes make this a perfect blueprint for a crossover movie. \n Frank Miller has effectively injected RoboCop into the world of Terminator, where its future, as we all know, is dominated by Skynet robots who are on the verge of annihilating the human race and any living creature on the planet. It is not forced. Even though RoboCop plays the protagonist here, the our Skynet steel buddies are given respect and enough badassery for a thrilling showdown. And yes, each battle gives man-giggles. \n Seek this one out if you want a solid yet mindless sci-fi entertainment.",

There are no intricate stories woven across the pages. The whole story just focuses on Man of Tomorrow and how he keeps his secret identity. \n I rarely read comics that ends as uplifting as Secret Identity. \n Secret Identity can pass as an origin story, but it does more by following Kent's (and Lois') life through the years.

As the superheroes find out the person responsible, filthy secrets about our beloved characters are laid bare. Brad Meltzer has effectively humanized many DC heroes and villains, putting them in a situation where their superpowers are close to being useless and playing with their emotions as if you were reading a novelized drama anthology. \n Dirty things happen and are uncovered in Identity Crisis. For one, there is rape. I personally don't like a rape scene in any story. The rapture of female divinity is almost always present in these so-called \"mature\" stories mainly for its shock value. If not for its great and immersive story, I'd give Identity Crisis a one-star. Then there are other things like morally questionable decisions, deaths and other devastating repercussions, it's a Crisis event in the first place. \n Speaking of an immersive story, this one is page-turner. This collected edition is filled with mystery, red herrings and plot twists. The little details in the dialogue and facial expressions give the characters a sort of dark vibrancy. There are some chapters that shine above the rest like the issue about fathers. \n I agree with you, Rags Morales. This is my personal best emotional panel in Identity Crisis. \n Rags Morales' facial artwork and close-up panels do the trick in emphasizing emotional distress. This close-up technique is even present in fight scenes and I love the claustrophobic feel it gives. The Deathstroke vs. all gruesome fight scene deserves a standing ovation. \n Thank you, Deathstroke for this insanely delicious one-versus-JSA fight. \n Identity Crisis is a must-read for DC fans. Be prepared though for there are things you cannot unread. The end may be a bit corny and shallow but overall it is great in a grim way.",

        "text": "This debut issue is truly a horrifying visual treat. Set most likely in a post-apocalyptic world (we haven't have much information about the Spread history in this issue), Spread #1 fuses Jordan's solid and concise narrative with Strahm's beautifully ugly environment and people. I love the stark contrast between the relaxed, monotonic narrator voice and the hopeless, violent world. \n Spread #1 doesn't tell much about the Spread's history, though we can say that it has been there for quite a long time. It focuses on the protagonists, the bad people and what the Spread are capable of doing. \n I will stick with this one and see where things go in issue number 2.",

        "text": "Superman: Birthright is an excellent origin story. If you get the impulse to know how exactly Supes started, then this is the only comic book you need. The subplots on the other hand are just ordinary. It touches on so many points of Clark's life that it doesn't really go deep on most of them. \n Birthright's story started strong. The Africa story is a heartfelt and a convincing anecdote in Kent's life to don the red cape (and underwear) and carry the great moral responsibility. After that, the Clark Kent - Superman journey from the barn to the big city is everything you have expected. \n Then there is Luthor. \n As an aside, let us take a look about why Batman Year One is the definitive Batman story, and perhaps the top Bats story of all time. The answer is simple: you have no villain. We just focus ourselves with Batman, Gotham and Gordon. Frank Miller could have added the Joker but he did not, because an arch-enemy as early in a hero's early career would have stolen the spotlight. Besides, it's inevitable for the Joker to have his own origin story (The Killing Joke). \n That is the problem with Birthright, it has given a lot of panels to Lex Luthor. The main thesis is that Superman is the symbol of hope and courage. That is him. That is why we need a Superman. Instead, Birthright forced a reason for the people to need Supes, that the exposition of the thesis felt contrived: we need Superman because there is a super-villain. I lost interest by the time the final series of battles started. For me it was just a messy cocktail of destruction and rescue. \n Yu has done a great job in his artwork though. I'm just not a fan of his under lashes. \n Superman: Birthright is a modern origin story of the Man of Steel. It is modern but not definitive. Just don't expect Batman: Year One or All-Star Superman level of feels.",

        "text": "Habibi is poetry. \n There is never a single thought that can describe Craig Thompson's masterpiece. It flows of emotions and sings a rhythm of life itself - a musical temple draped with concepts and events fused together in a sacred tome of sequential art in its highest degree. Pardon the abstraction but this is what this graphic novel endows you, a literary experience that only this particular medium can accomplish. \n Panel coherence. Through Thompson's writing, the panels move seamlessly and effortlessly with parallelism and play with words. Note how the last panel connects with the first one. \n Contrast and Parallelism. This page is wordless yet utilizes contrasting elements for a flawless panel progression. The light/dark, full/empty and outside/inside contrasts are the more explicit ones. More subtle parallelisms can be observed like the panel placements: boat (3-4) and food (6-7). The character's general direction is also alternating as right-left throughout the panels. Lastly, the 9th box connects with the first one. \n At its core, Habibi is a story of Dodola and Zam's life intertwined together from childhood to adulthood and beyond. It is a chronicle of their life as they wade through the sea of harshness and calm, of despair and hope. God, I love Thompson's parallelism and contrast style! But this book is way more than that, it is an exposition of Middle Eastern (or west Asian, depending on your point of reference) culture, beliefs and knowledge. \n Details. Here we see a bored sultan. The shading matches the gloom and laziness of the page. But actually the shade is made up of so many line streaks. \n Reading Habibi is like swimming through a big ocean. There are wave troughs and peaks, producing a calligraphic melody of ups and downs. From these waves you can form patterns, patterns which are either parallel or contrasting, but all symmetric to some degree. At the end, these waves come to a full circle where the end is a culmination and as well as a beginning. The beginning, on the other hand, is both a start and a terminus. \n Uniquely-drawn patterns. Each tiny detail in a pattern, though seemingly the same with others, are drawn individually. Wow. \n With regards to recurring themes and objects, Habibi forms a fractal. Everything is related and everything is a layer on another one. It is an intricate weave of words and illustrations. No matter how you look, details or the whole picture, everything is beautiful. \n The Fisherman. This altruistic fisherman, with his pragmatic and simple-minded persona, is the most complex of all the characters in Habibi - an element of contrast in character development. \n No matter where you look at it, Thompson has crafted a marvelous and timeless piece of literary material.",

        "text": "I don't know what was inside DC's mind when they published Zero Hour: Crisis in Time. They have \"cleaned\" the DC Universe during the 1985 Crisis on Infinite Earths, so Crisis in Time either finished the 9-year old Crisis crossover, retconning some series and ending others; or made its readers even more confused with the aftermath new universe. \n There are many elements in Zero Hour which are similar to Infinite Crisis. The good thing is that the former is less cluttered with characters. It is easier to follow. Considering that this is only a 5-issue series, Zero Hour didn't suffer the repetitiveness problem of Infinite Crisis. I liked the story and the pacing. \n By the way, what happened to Darkseid?",

        "text": "By the seven seas, Crisis on Infinite Earths is a long read for a comic book trade paperback. What is meant to be read for a year is not meant to be read for a few days. A maxi-series of epic proportions, Crisis on Infinite Earths literally destroyed universes and traveled dimensions even beyond space and time for an epic series that simplified the DC universe and paved the way for other publishers to do line-wide crossovers - something which was unheard of during that time. \n The year was 1985, the same year I was born when Crisis on Infinite Earths was published. Even without ample knowledge about the gold, silver and bronze ages of comic books, I can say that this a very well-researched piece of work. I discover at least one new DC hero, superhero and villain at every page. Kudos to Wolfman and Perez, they managed to fit in all those characters in one story. The story is simple: all DC characters must unite against a single foe to save their whole multiverse. The salvation comes with a hefty price. There are so many catastrophes and deaths here. Whole universes are annihilated in just a few pages. \n Infinite Earths has so many meta-comments that tell the survival of life as the survival of DC itself. It kinda makes me wonder how really big this event was during the year it was originally published, how many characters and stories you have to kill (some may have been built for years) just to clean the slate and simplify the DC line of publications for new readers. It was effective for me when we are talking about DC's new 52 as I am picking up Bats, WW and Aquaman until now. \n Aaah. \n You cannot blame Wolfman for making an otherwise straightforward story a bit crowded and convoluted. We are talking about 50 years of history here. And they must have some degree of respect by making sure that each patch of history is shown here, albeit rather short. The plot progressions felt formulaic and repetitive at the final chapters, making the end a little anticlimatic. Moreover, many character (especially hero-villain) pacts are made to be overly fast just to conveniently move the plot forward. This is understandable but awkward. \n Almost 30 since its publication, the DC multiverse is alive and well again. The Crime Society is back, Supergirl still flies, Earth-2 exists, Barry Allen is still running and many more. Infinite Earth's effects may have faded. And it has to be that way because for something to survive, it has to progressively evolve. So yeah, DC forever.",

Even Rodski's pure English dialogues feel pretentious and shallow. Moreover, you don't give the subtitle \"Ang Dalagang Baby\" then sprinkle the content with Rodski doing sexually suggestive poses. That doesn't feel right. \n The graphic novel touches on so many genres but never really went deep with one. Worse, the ones which are brought in the story are mostly genre cliches! It begins with a supernatural foreboding. The middle part is a disjointed mess of family drama, political drama (god I hate this China vs. RP thing), sci-fi and romance. In the finale, after Rodski becomes Lara Croft our story ends, of course, with a happily ever after. Anong nangyari kay Sir Gerry A? He is the man I looked up to and respected after reading his Elmer, Wasted, Bold Stars and Sim. Anong nangyari kay Sir A na nagbigay buhay muli sa El Indio ni National Artist Francisco V.

Bruce Wayne is still crude and rude, but him being idealistic and egotistic are already there. \n This fourth volume of the New 52 Batman series is also a modern retelling of how Bruce realized he should become a Bat. All the elements are there: the well, the brooding on the sofa, the bat. Nothing has been changed, only added. I'm not really a fan of this addition but I feel that it is a best compromise between being faithful to Batman's origin while still giving some fresh new elements in it. \n As for the villains, the Red Hood gang is present, so perhaps the origin (?) of a major villain, though I liked The Killing Joke way more. \n Nygma and Bruce's conversation is a fantastic piece of dialogue and full of symbolisms like the Sphinx and the ouroboros. This is a super cool way to see how Snyder writes a script which will be spoken by genius characters. Great start, and now I'm ready for Dark City. Yeah.",

Sanduguan ng Sangkalawakan may not be the best in the series but this certainly is a very memorable one for its fans. The comics started great, it has given me consistent laughs. Worth mentioning is the Banahaw arc. I believe it is the best in this volume. Oh Prof. Nilo Ocampo? Asteeg mehn. This volume's cover is by the way the best for me among the ten. \n Sanduguan ng Sangkalawakan struggled in the middle part though. The punchlines felt a bit forced while other strips were too preachy and not funny at all. Even Bertong Badtrip's ever-gruesome but satisfying retribution to annoying people regressed to Bertong Badtrip being well, just badtrip. But it managed to redeem itself in the homestretch. The occult, classroom situations, gore, introverted behavior, and metaphysical banats are funny again! \n Kikomachine Komix 10 has an unexpected touching moment.

This may very well change the status quo of Wonder Woman being not just an amazon princess, but also went full Kratos and becomes the God of War ! \n The Wonder Woman vs First Born fight, though something to look forward to in this volume, is not the main attraction of this book. \n Think of the story of as a sort of mid-season finale of Brian Azzarello's Wonder Woman run.

Grant Morrison defines Superman not just a super strong man who is capable of doing labours which require otherworldly strength, but as an embodiment of all super things beyond strength that a man can do. \n Frank Quitely's version of Supes perfectly fits with Morrison's vision: godlike stature yes, but his face is so relaxed and his muscles are so unrestrained!

This volume collects the first of Lemire's issues, from 17 until issue 24. A sort of re-reboot, Green Arrow's status quo has been drastically changed - there's an almost new team, new villains and a deeper mythological element in the Green Arrow. \n Though some questions might have been answered by reviewers., let me answer two: \n 1. Is it okay for me to start reading GA #17 and skip all previous issues altogether? YES. Though there may be some parts wherein you see characters from the previous issues, all of them are just artwork and doesn't really affect the story. Reading issues 1-16 though gives you that tired and annoyed feeling, things which add to the excitement and relief once you get to read issue 17. For completist, of course buy all New 52 GA but for readers who don't want to see crap, then start definitely at issue 17. \n 2. Is Green Arrow (considering only Lemire's run) better than Hawkeye comics? Man, this is very, very difficult. Clint's is not a typical hero comics, but it's so entertaining and oh so consistently good, though it has gone stale on its recent issues, IMHO. Ollie's, on the other hand starts to build up momentum and an interesting plot. Each comics has its own merits and both awesome, so I'd reserve the judgment on which is better.",

        "text": "Sometimes, you just wish that Goodreads has more than five stars. This book is one of the super rare reasons why you need more stars than an \"amazing\" rating. Heck, I would not hesitate to give a hundred stars to the Death of the Family to express how deeply amazed I am to this Batman-Joker story. \n Yes, Death of the Family is that good. I couldn't think of another New 52 story arc better than this. \n For a long time, we haven't seen the Clown Prince of Crime in the New 52 right after that disgusting face removal he had in the early issues of Detective Comics. It turns out, he was preparing big time, his grand masterpiece for each members of the Bat family and most importantly to his one and only love - Batman (sorry Harley Quinn). \n The central thesis of the story is that the Joker thinks that Batman has gone soft and weak because of the other bats and birds in his hero gallery. He yearns for a stronger Batman, the one he knew before all other characters popped out. Those were the happy days for him. Just him and the Batman. So he devised and executed this overly complicated plan that would hopefully result to the death of the family, hence the arc title. \n This Batman is really screwed-up because his version of the Joker is downright crazy and has an absolute twisted-yet-brilliant brain. His introduction was perfect. The spine-tingling scene in GCPD really caught me. I genuinely got scared of this guy. That set the mood for the story. And my fear for Joker gradually increased as I read the issues, many thanks to Capullo's immensely great artwork. \n THIS. \n This Death of the Family has to be a definitive story in some way. Something that answers the question: which Batman story should I read if ____. Like for a definitive Joker (sort of) origin, read The Killing Joke. For a deifnitive Batman detective story, read The Long Halloween. For a definitive story about Batman with its back broken by an absolute brute in a lucha libre mask, read I don't know, Knightfall maybe? So what is Death of the Family? It is a love story. It is the definitive answer to the question: which Batman book should I read if I like to have a i-depth study of the Batman-Joker relationship? You may argue about that since the Killing Joke may answer this too, but man, don't deny the sheer entertainment you have experienced reading in DotF. \n Death of the Family is the very reason why I love Batman. He's not just a billionaire gadget guy who broods over his city and fights street crooks. He is both a man and a legend. He can be hurt a lot through his family yet the name and the cape still stands up to fight until the end. He cares for other people. Thank you Joker, for being the reason why Batman shows who he is and the best he is. \n Oh before I forgot, I love how Scott Snyder conjures a sort of hierarchy of the main Bat-villains. That is also exactly how I would rank them, if there is such a thing. But for me, nobody tops the Joker as the best villain. \n Snyder absolutely kills it. He knows the characters and he can create the best story out of their personalities, what makes them themselves. Capullo on the other hand is a monster. What he is doing in the series is godlike.",

        "text": "Perhaps the selling point of this book is its sheer size. The Joker: Death of the Family is larger by a couple of issues compared with the first crossover arc, the Night of the Owls. \n Not to be confused with the main Batman: Death of the Family story written by Snyder and drawn by Capullo, Joker: Death of the Family (JDotF) is a mashup of issues that spans across several bat-related titles, Nightwing, Batgirl and Suicide Squad to name a few. \n JDotF focuses on how the Joker affected each members of the Bat family. Some interesting dynamics emerged, in particular with Barbara Gordon, who we all know the Joker paralyzed in The Killing Joke. Each character tie-in story ends up with them being kidnapped by Joker, leading to the dinner issue in the main story arc. \n Joker: Death of the Family is not a necessary read in the Death of the Family storyline. In fact, I recommend against reading it so as not to tarnish the quality of the main arc. Completists (like me) obviously should have this in their comic shelf.",

        "text": "This Blood is Thick abruptly ends the spectacular JH Williams III run on Batwoman. Shame on DC, the title went full south afrerwards. After the Medusa attack on Gotham, you know that another epic story is building up again, one that is more personal, one that involves Batman himself. \n I love where the series is going, the marriage, the battle of the Bat-cousins with all other supporting characters thrown into the mix. Volume four sets all that up, giving us an exciting preview on what the Batwoman series can offer - the Kate-Sawyer marriage, the DEO, other members of the rogue's gallery and Batwoman's interesting relationship with Batman. The next arc could be what JH Williams III has been building up (with Rucka) since Elegy - the last arc towards a full circle. \n But unfortunately, things aren't good because DC wanted Kate to join the mainstream Bat-stories. D*ck move New52 DC! \n Artwork isn't Williams' but still way better than that of volume 2. You get an emerging trend here. Volume 5 MIGHT have been drawn by Williams. Shame we didn't get to see it. \n This Blood is Thick is much more personal, a start of a could-have-been-epic story of the Williams Batwoman run. This is the farthest it will take us folks, appreciate it, then stop reading the succeeding issues.",

        "text": "After that very disappointing volume two (which comes after an exceptional volume one), World's Finest is another great volume from the Batwoman run by J.H. Williams III. It is not as solid and crisp as Hydrology, but the visual treat and comic spectacle this has to offer is one of the best DC's New52 has to offer. \n As what I have said with every Williams III comic that I have read (Sandman Overture and Promethea), everything is colorful and graceful. Batwoman's body and lush and sexy but never objectified. She embodies strength and awesomeness. The city of Gotham is drawn with contrasts: dark skylines and grey streets stomped over by throngs of supernatural beings, costumed heroes and low-level thugs of gold. There's blood and gore and weird filthy mythology all around the place. With beautiful panels to frame the Gotham scene, you'd just want to sit back and appreciate what your eyes are seeing. \n But this third volume of Batwoman is far from being perfect, I thoroughly enjoyed it hence the 5 stars yet there are some things that I wanted to point out. World's Finest is too wordy. Well, ancient mythological characters tend to be talkative so there's that excuse. It is entertaining to read for a while but towards the end these words drag you down. The conflict also ended too abrupt! I mean EVERYBODY was talking about mother, mother, mother then the mother showed up then in a quick swoosh - resolution. A couple more pages (or even a final issue) could have mended it. Those were my minor gripes, but again I enjoyed this book. \n There's a splash page here that blew me away and my god it is so beautiful. Yes, I'm talking about the one with Sawyer and Batwoman.",

        "text": "Rereading Batwoman again after three years, and much like what I have felt before, this is the volume of Williams' run that I really wanted to skip. To Drown The World could have been way better without the jumbling timelines and so many character point of views. \n In fact, everytime you turn a page, there is a high chance that the story will take you three months ago, two days ago, 15 hours ago or whatever timeline the story wants you to see fron whoever character it wants you to experience. It is a very big letdown from the outstanding first volume since aside from knowing the story a chunk of a time, this whole jumping timeline approach is completely unnecessary. I don't see any reason that this Batwoman arc us told this way. Volume 1 manages to be exceptional by telling the story in a straightforward fashion. \n The first issue of this volume could start with Sune's capture, followed by a second issue that is Sune's rescue. A third issue could have been the ship party then the rest of the issues would be the assault on Falchion's secret base. \n Volume two is not anymore drawn by J.H. Williams, and yes it is so noticeable. Agent Chase is does not look so formidable anymore and as for all the characters, they have lost so much soul. Art isn't bad though, just not as good as before.",

        "text": "The Batwoman run of JH Williams III in the New52 is hugely unappreciated, taking a back seat behind powerhouse series like Snyder's Batman, Azzarello's Wonder Woman and even John's Aquaman and Green Lantern. But once you get to read this Kate Kane Batwoman, you cannot get enough of it. \n Hydrology starts the four-volume series written and drawn by Williams. And this I am very serious about: these four volumes is as good as it gets. Batwoman is awesome, powerful, broken and again, awesome. Damn cool Kate Kane is. \n J.H. Williams III's panels are beautifully constructed! \n The first thing that you will notice here is the artwork. Williams sure has the talent to draw unconventional panels that perfectly complements the occult-supernatural story of this arc. The way he draws Batwoman, she's super sexy, yet not objectified. There is grace and sensuality in all her movements, a stark (yet equally effective) contrast to Batman's sharpness. \n Kate Kane's lesbian sex aspect is seen here, yet it is not overemphasized that I saw it as a natural and grounded part of the story, instead of being pretentious and preachy. I don't know really if her personality is gender-accurate but all I can say is she's a damn strong woman. \n I recommend Batwoman Hydrology if you want to a good story with some great artwork.",

Even though it is not as engaging and frenetic as the first two volumes, Wonder Woman: Iron still gets a five-star rating from me. Azz can seamlessly merge two different sets of characters together, the old gods and the new, into one cohesive story where technology meets magic. \n I also love the interplay between the characters. It is interesting to see how Hera, a goddess in the previous volumes, become a mere mortal. She, together with Zola offer comic relief in an otherwise very serious tone of the story, I mean where do you see a goddess raving over a soft vanilla ice cream? . \n It's on!

Thanks to this, together with Waid's spectacular run on Daredevil, these made me a Marvel reader as well (or at least a DD HE reader). \n Hawkeye is funny, sharp and a delicious read. It doesn't have that typical comic book hero formula. Thank you Fraction, thank you! \n Artwork is awesome. Super awesome. There is some hint of Chris Ware's Jimmy Corrigan here and there plus a little of Darwyn Cooke, but don't get me wrong! This is one hell of a unique visual treat. \n Read Hawkeye.",

The Dream Hunters is a trademark Gaiman storytelling: simple, elegant and strangely familiar yet enthralling and engaging from the start to the end. \n Amano? Is he a god? YES. Oh hell yes. He made this novella an art museum! Before I was only exposed with his Final Fantasy art, and indeed those are fantastic.

J-clone going all rebellious and punk is not worth the hype. \n There is so much blasphemy in this material. I'm okay with that on a literary level, but I think that putting Jesus' character here as a marketing ploy is offensive, considering the shallowness of the story. \n If there is any redeeming element, it is the art.

        "text": "Nigh of the Owls is the first crossover of Batman titles during Snyder's spectacular run in the New 52 Batman. As Alfred calls for an almost distress signal, most of the members of the Bat family (hmmm, Batwoman is doing an equally awesome series that time so she was absent) responded. Night of the Owls is a collected mashup of Bat and Bird heroes against the the Talons of the Court of Owls. \n Unfortunately, they are really not at par with Snyder's obviously superior storytelling and Capullo's equally great artistry. Most of the titles are just action issues with little or no philosophical investment, save fore some like the Gray Son of Gotham. Robin has some shocking panels. The rest are just okay. \n Oh yeah, there's an armored Batman suit that literally belittles the many Talons that attacked the Wayne Manor. Crazy.",

        "text": "Without the Before Watchmen label, I honestly believe that Minutemen could have done better in terms of sales and the number of nerdy discourses it could have sparked. Darwyn Cooke has crafted a beautiful yet downright dark and heavy story about this group of masked vigilantes. \n In many ways, Minutemen mimics what the Alan Moore has done excellently in Watchmen: that is the character interactions that ultimately led to the implosion of the gang itself. It is a multilayered clash of persona that kept the Minutemen interesting to read. \n I also believe that Darwyn Cooke (may he rest in peace because I still cannot move on to the reality that the devil 2016 took a great person's life) deserves recognition from this work. The way he reveals (or hides) things to his readers, on how he messed with our minds, is simply no less than brilliant storytelling. \n In the end, as what the Comedian has also explained in a meta-ish way, there are many versions of the truth. So even though the series did not give its readers the \"real\" truth, we just have to settle for the one that gives us comfort. \n You should really, really have to read Before Watchmen's Minutemen. The other BW series are entirely optional, but certainly not this.",

This series is top 2 in my list of DC's New 52 titles, with Snyder's Batman on the top spot and Geoff Johns' Aquaman run as my third. This first volume introduces Diana and her roots, both as a goddess and an amazon warrior without compromising its story quality and not falling into the \"another origin story\" trap. \n Hell yeah Wonder Woman! \n It feels like Azzarello is really cooking a genuine modern Greek mythology story, seamlessly adding the Amazonian lore into the vat with Wonder Woman as the focus, the main ingredient in arguably one of the author's chef d'oeuvre. \n You know how Wonder Woman Blood reads? With gods as characters, expect ridiculously crazy things. Betrayal. Deceit. God games. I am amazed how original the story is, yet reading it feels so familiar. Maybe because we have been accustomed to reading to such Greek-themed stories in high school. \n Wonder Woman volume one is fast-paced. It is a reader-friendly piece for those who want to start reading about the Amazon Princess.",

What are his powers, what are his limitations? It is Aquaman 101 without the lessons. It has Aquaman jokes, yes. But The Trench will make you respect him. \n Volume one has a number of heartfelt and funny moments. But what made it close to my heart is that Geoff Johns created a world where Aquaman is really a joke, a target of ridicule and fish jokes. It is a sight to see how Aquaman (and Mera) handles these situations. \n Ivan Reis' art is a marvel. The spreads are always delicious to look at. The watery, shiny, and luminescent coloring perfectly matches the artwork. \n Edit: DCEU's Jason Momoa Aquaman is not based on this New 52 version of Arthur Curry. Momoa is more of a 90s Aquaman, a badass-looking long haired bravado personified.",

        "text": "I like the conclusion of this Before Watchmen series. The four-issue Nite Owl feels more like a Nite Owl/Rorschach team-up. Compared with Ozymandias and The Comedian, BW: Nite Owl is smaller in scale, more grounded and less in philosophy and politics. That's why I keep on saying that this series might be the easiest to read among all the Before Watchmen titles. \n J.M. Straczynski has told snippets of Dan Dreiberg's life: his youth, his training with Hollis Mason and eventually his encounters with fellow masked people. Along the way, JMS has delivered a respectful origin story about two of the inanimate objects in Watchmen, namely the framed picture of The Twilight Lady which Silk Spectre has asked about in Watchmen and the \"The end is nigh\" placard Walter J. Kovacs shamelessly paraded on the streets. \n I guess the definitive traits of the second Nite Owl has been effectively represented in this series. He is a gadgets man who has a strong sense of responsibility to uphold law and order, is weak on women, has retrained sexual urges but mysteriously gets the girls nonetheless. \n I cannot really say if Nite Owl is a necessary read, but at least JMS writes a fun, engaging and action-packed series.",

        "text": "Since I have read this New 52 Superman years ago, my review will have a retrospective element in it. \n It has then been revealed that there are two Supermen (minus the infinite number of Supermen multiverse, we will not be talking about it), one pre-New52 Supes and the other New52 Superman. This volume establishes who our New52 Superman is: a whiny kid with superpowers who feels empty inside. \n What Price Tomorrow is more engrossed in establishing the New52 landscape of Metropolis - a sprawling megacity higly dependent on hi-tech journalism. So engrossed that Superman Volume 1 becomes muddled with real-time reporting, T.V. and all social media technology that persists nowadays. There's even a scene that Superman himself depended on the reports and television to defeat the (boring) enemy. Everything imploded and ultimately failed in effectively conveying to the audience what the New52 playfield has become. Worse, this first volume, which set the boring tone for the other Superman arcs also failed in establishing who Superman is in the modern landscape. No, this is not the Superman we are looking for. \n When we imagine Superman, we hear that fanfare, that S crest in the chest, the red and blue, and most importantly, the hope. That is the Superman we are looking up to, a god among humans. This Clark Kent, this new Superman is not that Superman. This Superman is just a fighting machine, uninspiring and boring. \n That is so bad, because George Perez has been part of DC's groundbreaking Crisis on Infinite Earths, and have written a couple of Superman issues before (which I admittedly haven't read), so he should know what he's writing. \n I'm glad that the Superman series in DC Rebirth brought back the old one.",

More details about the Court were revealed, some are sad like the Pennyworth family backstory while some are both confusing and almost unbelievable, like the revelations about Bruce's parents. \n The whole arc culminates with another Talon, a fight between nocturnal animals, Owl to Bat.

Though I started reading comics before that, superhero comics wasn't really my thing. \n Until Snyder's Batman. \n The Court of Owls is arguably the best start has happened in The New 52, under the best series in the era. If there are some more series to be on the good side, I believe it's gonna be Azarrelo's run on Wonder Woman, Johns' Aquaman and Green Lantern runs and William's severely unappreciated Batwoman run. But no series has been consistently better than the Batman of the Snyder-Capullo creative tandem. \n Right of the vat, you'll see some action between Batman and the rogue's gallery. The Bat family, specifically the Robins are also introduced one-by-one. \n Though the shining jewel of The Court of Owls is the the organization itself, the mystery and power it has on Gotham, something that is intertwined with the Wayne family creeps me out. And I'm yet to say that they have these zombie-brutes called the Talons. So creepy-amazing. \n Greg Capullo's art shines here. He's the perfect bro for Snyder. They should be bestfriends forever. I absolutely love the psychological torture panels he drew (god, the white, red and black color contrasts), from the subtle changes in Batman's emotions to the almost monster-like portrayal of the members of the Court and Batman himself. \n The whole story arc oozes with mystery and action, ending on something which is sure to shake the very foundations of Gotham City!",

The readers need this much-needed break, so here we see some classic comic book vigilante mission with all pseudoscience stuff the evil men planned to destroy a city and make a statement. \n This is an unexpected detour though. It is a welcome change but it felt a microbit off with the overall tone of the series. \n At the end, there is a scene which almost confirms a truth that I do not want to accept.

Believing that Immateria exists is believing that all products of the imagination indeed exists and sometimes manifest in the real. It is not a religion. In fact, it precedes religion. The real world is even a part of the Immateria universe as well. I love chapter where the skirmish between two Prometheas is interpreted as a schism of religion between Islam and Christianity.",

The only key event here was the unfruitful first meeting of these crime busters who will later call themselves as the Watchmen (minus Captain Metropolis). Little we knew that it was very fateful to Ozymandias himself, that it is his sole task who should save the world (didn't he realize it before?). \n Nostalgia \n Edit: I just read the meeting scene in Watchmen. Len Wein copied this whole part dow to the last words and lets Jae Lee reimagine it with a focus on Ozymandias. Pretty awesome if you ask me. \n We also see yet again some interesting dialogue between the Comedian and Ozy. Their word skirmishes and clash of ideologies definitely carry over to the main Watchmen story. The Cuban missile crisis and JFK's assassination were also here to fill up a couple more pages. There was one panel there which gives a nod to the final conversation between Veidt and Dr. Manhattan in Watchmen, that even the smartest man in the world can solve all of the world's problems.",

The narration is great and Darwyn Cooke is smart enough to give facetious remarks that serve as references to Watchmen, like Laurie not dreaming of making out with the Nite Owl. \n More than just a panchira. This panel alludes to the one in Watchmen where the Comedian is thrown outside his condo unit. \n This is also a love letter to all YA stories with themes that center on freedom, rebellion and maturity. Laurie has finally realized what Sally Jupiter has been training her for, yet still having her own set of rules.",

As many of us remember, Moloch the Mystic was the old and retired Watchmen villain who served as the Comedian's impromptu confidante. He was one of the last people the Comedian has seen. \n In this two-part series, we see a bit more of Moloch's backstory as a freak with a f*cked up youth who grew up using magic to do criminal activities. The story is very straightforward, but J. Michael Strazynski manages to tell the story surprisingly good, combining noir feels combined with an effective dose of sex, drugs, booze magic and booze. \n If you are interested with knowing more about the Watchmen lore, well the time is nigh to read this because these guys are at the footsteps of today's DC Rebirth era.",

        "text": "Batman: Hush boasts a ridiculous amount of characters from both the hero bunch and rogue's gallery. Pairing Loeb's noir style with gold-standard Jim Lee art, the love child of talents is a comic book buffet of over-the-top action with a healthy serving of mystery. \n Now just like in the buffet restaurant, every grub demands to be munched because all of them looks so tasty. That's where the problem starts. The reader may be so full that s/he cannot take anymore of the comic food. Batman: Hush is like that. It is tasty to read, but at some point you may lose track of what you are reading because of the sheer amount of things happening in it. The reader is barely given a breather, and what s/he experiences is panel after panel of action and mystery. \n Not that the Hush storyline doesn't have something good to offer. From Loeb and Lee? No, it has to be good. In fact it is, but there is just too much goodness in it that I wasn't able to absorb everything. By the end of each issue I still have to reread some parts only to understand what really happened or what has developed in the story. I can say that there's two main questions in the book: One, \"Who is Hush?\" and 2. \"Who is behind everything that's happening?\". The mystery unfolds like a much denser version of The Long Halloween coming to a full circle at the very end. \n The action choreography is undoubtedly Jim Lee. And IMHO, his art is at the forefront of this era of comics. I have nothing against the writing and art individually, though when put together, there is this feeling that the mix isn't entirely organic to create the story it should have become. \n Yet, I liked Batman: Hush. It is a good go-to comics if you do not have something in mind, just something to read in order to kill time. I feel that it was better to read it in individual issues than as a collected edition. The story doesn't stay in your heart like the Killing Joke or even Under the Red Hood, but just enjoyable enough to be a recommended read.",

The artwork is the best I have seen from Frank Miller. \n 300 the graphic novel holds the manliness record for the densest number spears, arrows, shields, red capes and abs in graphic literature. \n I love 300 for what the satisfaction it gives from its mindless fun and glorious action.",

Before Watchmen: Ozymandias enriches the lore by showing interesting interactions between other soon-to-be Watchmen members and at the same time beefing up Ozymandia's exploits in his grand ambition of world domination. Props to Len Wein for being faithful with all the characters' personalities in the dialogues. \n The cover is an obvious give away as to which Watchmen member he has encountered, but Mr. O did see another one in this issue.

The first of three parts (as indicated in the cover) but the second in the series, Zsazsa Zaturnnah sa Kalakhang Maynila chronicles the life of Ada (Zsazsa Zaturnnah) and her boyfriend Dodong in Manila. \n In the first graphic novel, province Ada got a Darna-like but ridiculously large stone that enables her to transform as voluptuous Zsazsa Zaturnnah. This has made her defeat a giant frog, zombies and the Amazonistas. Ada seemed to have won the jackpot. Not because of the stone but because of Dodong. \n Now the two of them have traveled to the capital (because you know, work and greener pasture), author Carlo Vergara expands the Zaturnnah universe by introducing new allies and villains as well as opening the window to Ada's past. \n Sa Kalakhang Maynila part one patterns its story and humor to the first one - the quirks, the jokes and the fight scenes. I particularly find Ada's face change from demeaning to cartoon ugly while being flirted by Dodong very hilarious. While this rehash may be a good choice because I didn't see anything wrong with the debut graphic novel, Sa Kalakhang Maynila doesn't offer something new style-wise. The reason for this might be attributed to the stellar \"performance\" of the Amazonistas that cannot be easily matched. In short, I am not saying that Sa Kalakhang Maynila part one is bad, the very first one is just that good. \n If you are looking for a Filipino graphic novel, the Zsazsa Zaturnnah must definitely be one in your pull list. After all the years that has passed since this was published, I thought part two will never be realized. Then poof, now available at bookstores!",

        "text": "Just because you are a fan of Alan Moore, and A Small Killing happens to have his name slapped on the cover doesn't mean you are going to love this graphic novella. No sir, I didn't get whatever deconstruction of concepts this book has. I am simply not prepared (or way too dumb) for what A Small Killing has to offer. Beneath its simple plot about Timothy Hole in his quest to sell a soda brand in Russia and a creepy, playful child who haunts him is an internal monologue of how our adman \"protagonist\" sees the world and everything in between. His words for me are complex digressions from the central plot and I often find myself at lost with his train of thought. \n Now I feel dumb against the other reviews that I have read here in Goodreads, which either praises the material or fleshes out the details I have deliberately neglected. Man, I just wish I had the same level of appreciation as theirs. As my final words before I succumb to reading mainstream comics, let me just say a cliched phrase that summarizes my reading experience with A Small Killing: \"this book is not for everybody\".",

All of us remembers her in Alan Moore's Under the Hood side stories as the lesbian vigilante who dedicated her life fighting pedophiles. Anchoring on these basic description of her persona, Darwyn Cooke adds more depth in who she really is. \n Aside from the ad hoc tandem between her and Nite Owl, we also see the start of Edward Blake working with the Feds. Consistently with the Watchmen comics, Eddie is the one who sees both the \"joke\" and the truth. Mothman's demise also start to form up too. \n Issue number three is a solid Minutemen story as Darwin Cooke crafts a a convincing character study about how messed up they really are.",

Last time I've read Watchmen, Dr. Manhattan can perceive time differently than us, yet he cannot change the events that have already happened and even the future, or at least he doesn't want to. Here's a story where Jon can see events that happened OUTSIDE his own timeline. He sees himself not becoming Dr. Manhattan, getting out of the chamber and not molecularly separated in the intrinsic field generator. \n What's in the box? The Schrodinger's cat is a clever way to start the concept about parallel universes. \n Dr. Manhattan is the trickiest one to write. The writer must be able to communicate effectively to its readers how the Doctor can perceive things. JMS so far has been able to do this effectively. I think that his Schrodinger's cat analogy/allusion with Jon Osterman's fate is a good theme to start this four-issue series.",

        "text": "Rorschach issue one is beautifully drawn. The gritty realism that Lee Bermejo gives in his illustrations is something worth seeing. But behind the gloss and the blood of the painted city is hides some serious problems with the Rorschach's Before Watchmen series. \n This is the work of award-winning writer Brian Azzarello. He also did that awful Comedian series. Though Azzarello builds up the overall tone of the story and its world, he seemed to have it all wrong in characterization of Rorschach (as what he have done with the Comedian). The first thing that Watchmen fans will be looking for must be faithfulness to the original material. Deviation and personal interpretation is welcomed, but the core must be there. Rorschach is way more than a detective vigilante as what he is portrayed here in the series. He is the readers' eyes to whatever is happening in this world, the true watchman. Our protagonist and the narrator. \n So you do not separately introduce a main character without him, like The Bard who I suppose is the main antagonist in this 4-issue series. Rorschach can be beat up, but it is such an utter disgrace to see him beaten. \n I'm sorry to tell that the script is lazy too. No this is not a rant because I have absolutely loved Azzarello's other works. Forgiven, that the journal entry narration is not at par with Alan Moore's, but for the love of Dr. Manhattan, I never expected that he will commit the \"never leave a character to die without making sure about his death\" cliche. \n The \"bad people leaving without seeing the protagonist really die\" cliche \n To be fair, Rorschach is accurately depicted as brutal and very capable of fighting mano-a-mano against many. \n Going back with the art, Bermejo's illustrations alone make this issue worth seeing. Although at some panels, Rorschach's inkblots looked like they're just being glued into the fabric. Also, why doesn't Rorschach wear pinstripe pants? \n It's too early to judge if this series will go bad. It has some serious flaws yes, but it deserves another chance.",

Issue two, which by itself a stark departure from what is set up in the first issue, concentrates more on building the 'Nam war theater rather than developing Eddie Blake's personality. He is not Rambo-Commando. Joke and Truth. These are the definitive themes of the Comedian. He saw Ozymandia's silly jest, for him everything is a joke - life, god, the American dream.

        "text": "Happy 2017! My first (Re)read this year is Before Watchmen: Ozymandias. This six-part series is written by Len Wein and illustrated by Jae Lee. \n We all know Adrian Veidt or Ozymandias as the one closest to being an antagonist in the Watchmen series. This guy, dubbed as the \"smartest man of the world\", the one who was the one responsible for millions of deaths at the end of Watchmen is more than that. This origin story of Veidt adds more depth and ambition to his character. \n Len Wein interprets Ozymandias as a narcissistic and egotistic man, who with his intellectual and physical prowess plans to rule and change the world. Geez, number of \"I\"s in this issue is significantly more than the \"na\"s in Hey Jude. Wein has carefully crafted the significant moments of Veidt's life from youth until the moment he decides to wear that awful purple robe and boots. \n Jae Lee in his unique art perfectly complements Wein's interpretation. The drawings are well-placed, almost always under the notion of self-centeredness and symmetry. Lee's art reeks of dark ambition, vague sensuality and pride.",

        "text": "Newsflash: Geoff Johns has just teased (January 1, 2017) that he's back to writing comics again in this tweet so aside from the DC Rebirth #1 reveal, I guess this is a high time for us to read Watchmen and the Before Watchmen series! \n Back to my review, Before Watchmen: Nite Owl is a details how Daniel Dreiberg, a nerd who is a very big fan of the first Nite Owl, managed to discover the secret hideout of Hollis Mason. Dan then later trained with Hollis as a protege, then eventually took up the mantle of the Nite Owl. The best scenes in this issue though are Nite Owl's awkward yet funny conversations with Rorschach. \n The nerd and the brooder as partners? It works. \n The first crimebusters meeting is also here. Unlike Len Wein's Ozymandias which has faithfully recreated the original material down to the last word, J. Michael Straczynski (6 consecutive consonants? Woah.) has changed bits of it, facetiously adding post-meeting dialogue between our BFF's Owl and Rorie. \n Nite Owl issue one is an easy read. Despite some of the heavy scenes it shows, it is lighthearted with a handful of quips that made me smile.",

        "text": "From what I remember back in 2012, the Comedian issues were the worst of the Before Watchmen lot. I am rereading it now partly because DC Rebirth has the Watchmen introduced in the world and not just an exclusive universe, and partly to see if my prior appreciation to the material (or the lack of it) has not changed. \n Now let us talk about the Comedian. If you want a better Eddie Blake backstory, you should read Darwyn Cooke's Minutemen. Edward's character there is much more consistent with Watchmen. \n Issue one does not actually have any serious flaws structure-wise. After all, it is Brian Azzarello who is writing this. It is just that he is not the Comedian we have known in Watchmen. Perhaps his time with the Feds or the Kennedy family that have changed him. But whatever the reason was, this is not the Eddie Blake I have expected. \n The story though is consistent with Comedian's theme in two ways: first, everything in the plot is a bit fat joke. Second, Moloch is present as a sort of friend and a confidante. Remember that in Watchmen, before somebody killed him, Blake went to Moloch to cry out whatever horror he has seen . \n Comedian, like Minutemen and Ozymandias runsfor six issues. So there are five more to go. Other Before Watchmen titles by the way run for at most four issues.",

Along the story she meets a pretty boy, someone with a nice chest she can lean to, he makes her weak. Problems then arise but in the long run this young lady emerges triumphant and strong. \n But like the other Before Watchmen titles, Silk Spectre is appreciated more when you are already familiar with the original Watchmen material.",

I have started with Moloch and Dollar Bill, and now Minutemen. \n This six-part series is written and illustrated by the late Darwyn Cooke. Issue one serves as an introduction to the members of the Minutemen, each having given a varied number of pages. \n If you are a fan of Darwyn Cooke and/or have read Watchmen, Minutemen is highly recommended. This series treads on a new path, an almost standalone story to the group which precedes the Watchmen themselves. \n With an average of three pages of exposure time per member, Cooke gives the right anount of backstory to them prior to the group being formed. \n Cooke's art style perfectly fits this post-prohibition era. His is definitely not a Jim Lee superhero art, but delves more on the feeling of an uplifting, beautiful nostalgia of simpler times. \n If there is only one Before Watchmen series I would recommend, it is Minutemen. The Dr. Manhattan series is the clear choice if one considers its relevance to what will eventually happen in the DC universe, but my vote goes to Minutemen in the quality department.",

        "text": "Ang El Indio ni Francisco V. Coching ay tunay na sumasalamin sa higit na kalinangan at yaman ng ating wikang Pilipino, kahusayan ng ating lahi sa pagguhit at pagsulat sa komiks at ang hindi matawarang kagandahan ng asal at kalooban ng ating lahi - salamat kay Gerry Alanguilan na siyang bumuhay sa obrang, kasama ang Vibal na muling naglimbag sa nobelang ito. \n Labis akong natuwa sa pagbabasa ng El Indio na siyang kinatatampukan ni Fernando, isang meztisong bumalik sa Pilipinas upang hanapin ang kanyang ama na siyang lalaking nagdulot ng kahihiyan at hinagpis sa kanyang ina sa kanyang pagbabalik sa Espanya. Marahil ang buong kwento ng El Indio ay tigib ng mga temang palasak na sa literatura - pag-ibig, paghihiganti, karangalan, bakbakan; ngunit ang bawat tema ay mahusay na itinatanghal sa paraang maayos, intelektwal at tunay na maipagmamalaki. Ito ang tipo ng literatura na dapat basahin ng mga mag-aaral at guro para sa diskursong pang-akademiko o ng sinumang mambabasang nais mamangha sa ating komiks. \n Walang kapansin-pansing bago sa El Indio. Alam mo na ito'y magwawakas nang maganda at masaya. Kung sabagay, ito ay orihinal na nailimbag noong 1953, kaya marahil ang laos na ngayon ay bagong-bago noong panahong iyon. Gayunpaman, malalim ang kwento nito, malalim sa damdamin, katuwiran at wika. \n Halimbawa, kung ating maririnig ngayon ang \"busilak ang kalooban\" ng isang tao, ito ay isinasabuhay sa kulturang popular bilang isang taong mabait (na madalas ay bata), inosente, nagpapaapi, matulungin, mahina, madasalin at kung kahit anong daluyong ang kanyang kakaharapin ay siya niyang mapagtatagumpayan sapagkat ang taong may busilak na kalooban ay ginagabayan ng Diyos. Si Fernando at ang ilan pang mga tauhang Pilipino, pati na rin ang ilang Kastila ay mayroong busilak na kalooban - at sila'y matapang, maginoo, marangal, malakas, may pananampalataya (rin). Sila ay lohikal mag-isip. Iyon ang malaking kaibahan! Kadalasang ang bida ngayo'y kulang ang lohika at mababaw, ngunit hindi sa El Indio. Isa pa ay ang mga salitang \"mula sa kaibuturan ng puso\". Malakas at tunay na damdamin ang naibibigay ng nobela, taliwas sa ating nababasa at lalo na sa napapanood ngayon. \n Sa bawat pahina ng El Indio, mayroong isa o dalawang salitang akong natututunan: sumikil, imbi, umigtad, aaglahi, yumukod, nasukol at marami pang iba! Grabe, napakayaman lang ng ating wika. Makailang ulit na tayong nakapanood ng lumang pelikulang Pilipino at tumawa habang nagsasalita sa paraang inaakala nating malalim na Tagalog, ngunit ganoon pala talaga ang paraan ng pakikipag-usap noong araw. (..Soweiz mga Bhoxz., Hehheeheeh,,.. whaLa jeJemon pHa.. haix..) \n Nais kong makabasa muli ng komiks na ang estilo ng pagguhit ay tulad ng El Indio. Nakakamangha ang detalye nito. Nararapat na sabihin ang ilan dito tulad ng pananamit ni Fernando bilang matador, ang bahay ng Vizcondesa sa Espanya at ang maaksyong paghaharap ng dalawang tauhan (na silang hindi ko babanggitin). Tunay na napakahusay ni Coching sa kanyang mga ilustrasyon. Bagaman hindi nito sinasabi na mas mababa ang kalidad ng talento ng ilang mangguguhit natin tulad nina Alanguilan at KaJo Baldisimo. Lahat sila ay kapwa magagaling sa kani-kanilang estilo. \n Hinihikayat kong basahin ninyo ang El Indio. Salamat Francisco V. Coching, tunay kang maipagmamalaki.",

        "text": "Zsazsa Zaturnnah, a graphic novel of pure entertainment. What Carlo Vergara did is to combine cliches, slapstick, chauvinism, popular culture references, gay chorvaness, basag-drama antics, sexual innuendos and stereotypical personas into a creation which is downright hilarious. Ang Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Zsazsa Zaturnnah does not just give a bang. It gives a bonggang-bonggang tarusshabang worthy of five flangganahstars. \n Almost everything in Zaturnnah is familiar. Zaturnnah for one is Darna gay-ified. The voluptuous and booby protagonist is the alter-ego of Ada, a gay beautician who must swallow an oversized meteorite in order to become her. Reading the graphic novel is like watching a typical Filipino movie. You will hear the familiar voice of the protagonist narrating introductions at the opening sequence and life's lessons in the final panels. The punchline styles are not uncommon as well. For example, seemingly melodramatic scenes end up with combo-breaker \"banats\". Familiar setting, familiar reactions. So why is Zaturnnah funny? Two reasons. First, Carlo Vergara simply did it so well. Second, there are things which the written (comic) medium can execute brilliantly as compared with its live-action counterpart. \n The artwork is just, wow. There may be panel inconsistencies and skips from time to time, but everything is forgiven because Zaturnnah is one hell of an artwork. The fight with the Amazonistas deserves an standing ovation. It displays Vergara's remarkable talent in action storytelling. \n Certain themes in Zsazsa Zaturnnah can be investigated for intellectual discourse. The most obvious of which is Ada being gay. Vergara gave suggestions of the marginalization of gay people in the society with the conversation of Didi and Ada right before his first transformation to Zaturnnah. The material also goes right into homosexual relationships. Up to a certain degree, one could also see themes on male opression and women empowerment as depicted in the tragic fate of planet X(XXxx...) and the Amazonista's struggle against the male-forms. But let me say that you should forget about these and take Zaturnnah as a reading material solely for leisure and entertainment. Just read it as it is, and you are going to love it right away. \n Laugh all the way with Zsazsa Zaturnnah. Everybody deserves to be entertained.",

        "text": "Remember, remember, the fifth of November. This is the part of the quote originally commemorating the gunpowder treason and plot to blow up the British parliament building in 1605 by a guy named Guy Fawkes, which reverberates in V for Vendetta - a story of struggle for freedom from a totalitarian world, wherein it is not the people who should fear their government, rather the government must fear its people. Alan Moore's V for Vendetta is a story about revenge transgressing to a revolution of a country. \n V for Vendetta is a highly political piece of literature meticulously embedded in the mysterious persona and history of V. Like Moore's creation of The Comedian in Watchmen, Gull in From Hell and his depiction of Joker in The Killing Joke, V has attained a certain kind of enlightenment, a sort of point of view high above, seeing all the people below and smelling the stench they emanate. It is Moore's storytelling genius which makes it possible to transcend V's personal Vendetta with the government to driving a society to rise up against its rulers. The longer the people are silenced, the louder their voices would be on the day of revolution. It is not a fight towards justice, for according to V, justice instilled with fear are short-lived and will never create long-term happiness. It is as well not a war for democracy, rather a reclamation of power, power to the people in a state of anarchy. Which is right and which is wrong? Alan Moore does not care about that. For all we know he might be laughing at the people being led to highly intellectual discourses and debates because of his works of fiction. He leaves that question mark for the readers to end it with a period. I prefer to leave it unanswered. \n Other than the politics of anarchy and facism, V's personality is worth mentioning as well. Alan Moore has created his most complex and mysterious character. On the outside he's an antihero who sought revenge and later became England's symbol of freedom from oppression. But there's more behind the eternally smiling white mask. Based on the graphic novel, V could be anyone and yet he is the one, he is both ugly and beautiful, romantic and straight, male and female, hero and enemy, crazy and enlightened. The suggestion of his (or her) true identity is there, yet Alan Moore has left enough space for reader interpretations. V is arguably the most complex protagonist or character I have ever read. \n Like his other works, V for Vendetta is carefully crafted and well-researched. Alan Moore has created an alternate history so deep and delicious that the events can actually happen in reality. Moore does not give you a feeling of an unnatural sequence of events because none of his characters are dumb enough to do comical and oftentimes ludicrous antics. All of Moore's characters (except for a few) are human, deep, crazy and intelligent, but never dumb. Moore is also a master of Britain's history, and how he beautifully decorates his creations with such. For one, V himself is a modern Guy Fawkes, or at least Guy Fawkes inspired V to dress-up like that and make the English people remember the fifth of November. One can also see in V for Vendetta references to historic events, say the Holocaust, the eve of the First World War and the Cuban and Argentine Revolutionary War. \n The artwork of V for Vendetta is dark and awesome. Originally printed uncolored, you can see right away that the artist David Lloyd is a master of shadows. Lloyd has perfected the placement of shadows on objects and humans and especially faces, creating an extraordinary detail each panel. There are two things I find most attractive in David Lloyd's art in V for Vendetta. First are the faces slightly lighted, revealing details, contours and realistic expressions. The other one is V's wig. There may be more complex literary characters than V, but no hairstyle or wig in the fiction realm can ever match the flawlessness of V's wig. \n The story of V for Vendetta is in fact gripping and powerful, yet it is deep that sometimes I myself am confused with what is happening in the story. It is more difficult to read than Watchmen, Moore's masterpiece which is considered as an intermediate read. There are certain points in the story that are hard to understand that trying to comprehend it somewhat defeats the entertainment and \"leisure reading\" value of graphic novels. But V for Vendetta still connects with the readers, no matter how deep you want to go in unraveling the intricacies in the story. V for Vendetta is a highly recommended graphic novel, with its entertainment element slightly being restrained by the political themes and issues which require a bit of thinking.",

        "text": "From Hell, a thoroughly satisfying graphic novel penned by Alan Moore and illustrated by Eddie Campbell delves in the dark shadows of London's Whitechapel district during the time when the world's most infamous serial killer stalked the impoverished streets of England, the one who was called Jack the Ripper. Based on the original murders of Victorian England, Moore has crafted a dark potion of fascinating gruesomeness and gore, London's history, geography and masonry, with a lovely serving of terrifying conspiracy. It is delicious, lunatic and heartless all at the same time.",

        "text": "Maus is on its core simple and raw, but so powerful it leaves something to every person who reads it. It is a tremendous work which is worth the time. This Pulitzer prize winning graphic novel is fairly straightforward with no symbolic illustrations and difficult words, aside from the obvious anthropomorphism of Jews as mice, Germans as cats and Poles as pigs. The dialogues are easy to read and surprisingly, not that heavy to stomach. There may be scenes there which are quite graphic (being that it tells about the Holocaust) with the ridiculous amount of deaths, but the power that resonantes from Maus is not from the genocide death-stench. Maus is full of painful, lasting tenderness. \n My friends, you should read this. This is deeper than a recommendation. It is a necessary read. If somebody asks what serious graphic literature to start with, Maus is my top-of-mind answer.",

        "text": "Visually explicit and disturbing, I bought this solely because it has Alan Moore as the author. What I got is more than what I have asked for. Jacen Burrows is indeed a talented artist. He is able to keep the intensity of the scenes, be it the mystery, the sensuality and the gore. Oh the gore. I wasn't ready for it, yet loved every bit (of flesh) of detail. Neonomicon is a graphic material which is definitely not for children. \n If you are of the conservative type or easily grossed out with sick mature themes of gore, sex and violence, skip this book. For many parts I thought that perhaps the graphic detail are way too much. Neonomicon gives it all, it gives it all fast and hard. \n But more than that is an underlying HP Lovecraft theme that is both salty and putrid that you can almost smell it in the book. Alan Moore certainly handles this theme with care, without giving all of the details. It seems that he is always hiding something from us (for a sequel maybe?) and that suspended thought lingers and haunts you for a while. \n Neonomicon is not for all. But yes, I enjoyed it very much.",

        "text": "Why is Watchmen considered as one of the greatest creations in not only graphic literature, but in literature in general? It is certainly not the best. We readers are our own subjective tastes. I can give you a list of graphic novels I have read that entertained me more than Watchmen. Alan Moore can be easily beaten by another writer in creativity. Dave Gibbons isn't the best comic book artist of all time. \n So why is this book, and I will go far with my words, is revered by many as one of the greatest, if not greatest of all time? That it is an iconoclastic and sacrilegious for someone to even touch and more so, expand its lore? Sure, it is era-defining. Watchmen is a definitive example of comic book culture maturity. Certainly, it touches on geo-socio-political events worldwide, depicted so effective and so organic that the things happening in this book are very believable, even though the main characters are nowhere to be seen in the real world. Of yeah, Alan Moore has crafted these Watchmen crimebusters as archetypes of nearly all superheroes in existence: a god, a techie vigilante, an anti-hero vigilante, an uber-cool vigilante, a fan-service heroine and a villain-hero (but honestly, you don't have a Deadpool in Watchmen). \n So again, why? \n This is my personal take on it: Watchmen is full of multi-thematic elements, told effectively in a self-contained story. This book has a say on almost anything about comic books, in many levels. Think about a theme in comic books, Watchmen would most likely have it. Simple themes would be godlike heroes, villain-hero relationships, salvation, vigilante, love and sex, crimebusting partners, and the list can go on. How about human frailty, the concept of life in the eyes of a god, the power of media, the repercussions of war, man's apathy on the things going on around him, deliverance from global conflict? I'm not saying that Watchmen has everything. In just covers a lot in its twelve issues. We can appreciate it in many levels: As an entertainment material, indeed you will be entertained without thinking too much about it. As a graphic novel, yeah it is great. As a piece worthy of academic discourse, yeah you can do that too. Every detail is important, every object has a story, everything, the Black Freighter, the hentai octopus giant monster, the smiley pin, the placard, even the Hollis Mason trophy is a piece of conversation. \n If someone tweaks, or adds something in the Watchmen lore, it is perfectly understandable that people would react, with some finding it sacrilegious. Perfectly understandable. I myself abhorred the idea of a Before Watchmen series (at first), disappointed with the ending of the Snyder's Watchmen film (but enjoyed it) and a bit skeptical (and excited at the same time) with Watchmen's incarnation in the mainstream DC universe. Why? Because this book is self-contained. I don't say that it is error-proof, or all loose ends are tied. Watchmen can just stand on its own. It is one big solid quilt where everything is connected. It has its flaws but far too light too bring the whole graphic novel down. \n Pick something from Watchmen, anything, and you can get a piece of conversation from it. Review a certain aspect of the graphic novel and you will be astonished on how so many things you can say with that just single aspect. Or you can just say \"I enjoyed it so much\", and it is perfectly okay. Alan Moore's Watchmen is about so many things. It is an essential literary work that everybody should read.",

These journeys were part of his religious training as a Buddhist monk as well as literary inspiration for his memorable and often painfully moving poems. The works he wrote during this time comprise a record of his quest for spiritual enlightenment.\nAlthough Santoka was master of conventional-style haiku, which he wrote in his youth, the vast majority of his works, and those for which he is most admired, are in free-verse form. He also left a number of diaries in which he frequently recorded the circumstances that had led to the composition of a particular poem or group of poems. In \"For All My Walking, \" master translator Burton Watson makes Santoka's life story and literary journeys available to English-speaking readers and students of haiku and Zen Buddhism. He allows us to meet Santoka directly, not by withholding his own opinions but by leaving room for us to form our own. Watson's translations bring across not only the poetry but also the emotional force at the core of the poems.\nThis volume includes 245 of Santoka's poems and of excerpts from his prose diary, along with a chronology of his life and a compelling introduction that provides historical and biographical context to Taneda Santoka's work.", "ratings_count": "56", "title_without_series": "For All My Walking: Free-Verse Haiku of Taneda Santōka with Excerpts from His Diary"},
