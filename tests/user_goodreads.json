At first, 12-year-old Luz balks, hardly thrilled by the prospect of actually having to walk to the mall. But Luz doesn't mope for long. After all, her name --- pronounced ?loose? --- means ?light.? Soon, this intelligent and spirited chica begins to understand that she must change with the times. As food prices rise, Luz decides to help create a more self-sustainable community by transforming a run-down city lot into a garden where she and her neighbors can grow their own fruits and vegetables. But when she solicits help from her friends --- boy-crazy Anika and computer-whiz Robby --- they think she's a little loco. Luz pedals her idea on the street, but the community is equally dismissive. Can Luz pull off her plan and help change her world alone? This graphic novel is a kid-friendly take on sustainable living in a fossil fuel-dependent world. Preteens will love the fearless, fiery and resourceful heroine and will find inspiration in her efforts to steer her society toward self-sustainable living. Hip and energetic illustrations bring Luz and her world to life in a jazzy, appealing fashion, and a bonus chapter teaches kids how to make garden compost.",

They certainly didn't realize that a seemingly meek Greek college student by the name of Elektra would become one of the most popular and memorable characters in the post-modern, increasingly adult world of comic books.Telling the story of how the death of her father drove an innocent, naive college student into a deadly trained martial arts assassin, this seminal work stands alone among the great stories to ever be produced in the graphic storytelling medium. Elektra became so popular, in fact, that even after her death, interest in the character was so high that a yearlong, multi-part epic was created entirely for her. Elektra: Assassin was immediately recognized as being like nothing that had come before. The fragmented, complex script by Miller was both dramatically compelling and darkly satirical.",

        "description": "The poetry selected for this volume comes from the Tang Dynasty (618907), an era when the influence of Buddhism was at its strongest in China. The best loved and most influential of all Chinese poems come from this period.\nLike all books in the Shambhala Calligraphy series, In Love with the Way takes a classic spiritual text that has been a subject for calligraphers for many years--and uses it to showcase a uniquely modern example of the calligrapher's art, bringing the text to life in a striking new way.\nIn Love with the Way is accompanied by Francois Cheng's introductory essay on poetry of the Tang period, and by a closing essay on the work of the calligrapher, Fabienne Verdier.\nCalligraphy (from the Greek for \"beautiful writing\") is an art where word and image meet, where the artist strives to give visual expression to the meaning of words in a way that transcends the text while remaining completely faithful to it. It is a discipline that has been invested with spiritual significance wherever it has arisen--and it has arisen throughout the world in every age, in virtually every language, culture, and religion.\nThe Shambhala Calligraphy series is a collection of books devoted to contemporary expressions of this \"art of the word,\" featuring contemporary calligraphers' striking new interpretations of texts that have been traditional subjects for calligraphic interpretation. Whether in Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, or Chinese pictographs, the characters, words, and sentences are brought to life anew here in a choreography of mind, hand, and heart by which letter and spirit fuse in a single stroke.",
