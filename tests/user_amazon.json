We recommend using this saw along with a miter guide of some sort to help ensure a straight and even fret slot. We carefully check and adjust the kerf widths on these after receiving them from the manufacturer, to make sure they will be suitable for cutting properly sized fret slots. Actual width of the teeth set when measuring with calipers may vary from .020 to .023 inches."

            "Omega Studio is a completely integrated computer recording system that includes the Omega 8x4x2 USB I/O Mixer, Steinberg's Cubase LE4 audio and MIDI recording software, and Lexicon's world-class Pantheon VST Reverb plug-in. The Omega Desktop Recording Studio quite literally contains all the necessary components to transform your PC or Mac computer into a professional 24-bit/48 kHz recording studio. Omega is an extremely flexible USB audio interface solution. With two microphone preamps, it's a great choice for singer/songwriters, duets, or you can record you and a friend playing guitar. There are also two stereo pairs of line inputs, which can accommodate your keyboard or synthesizer. And, on the front panel, there's a hi-Z instrument input, so you can directly plug in your guitar or bass. Omega provides a total of eight inputs featuring ultra-transparent A-to-D converters to capture your performance with pristine 24-bit quality. Two of the inputs feature extremely low-noise dbx mic preamps with +48V phantom power and TRS inserts. Four TRS active balanced line inputs accept up to +22dBu signals. Included is an S/PDIF input combined with an additional DAC for zero-latency, direct monitoring of the S/PDIF source for simultaneous tracking of analog and digital sources. Rounding out the full compliment of connectivity, Omega includes 2 TRS balanced line outputs, a 1/4\" high-power headphone output, a hi-Z instrument input, and MIDI I/O. Users can record 4 tracks at once from the 8 input sources. The unique mini-tower design offers individual level controls and peak meters for each microphone and line input. Cubase LE4 integrates seamlessly with Omega to achieve an easy-to-use, 48-track complete recording solution that includes all of the modules that you need to track, edit and mix your masterpiece. Then, to complete your mix with that legendary \"Lexicon Sound\u201d, Omega includes the Lexicon Pantheon VST Reverb plug-in which offers 35 factory presets and 6 reverb types.",

So when we set out to bring that sound home \u0096 we got truly inspired. THE COMPLETE SYSTEM Nothing is more frustrating than buying a \"recording system,\" only to find out that you need a gaggle of extras just to make it all work. Omega Studio is a completely integrated computer recording system that includes the Omega 8x4x2 USB I/O Mixer, Steinberg\u0092s\u00ae Cubase LE audio and MIDI recording software, and Lexicon\u0092s world-class Pantheon VST Reverb plug-in. The Omega Desktop Recording Studio quite literally contains all the necessary components to transform your computer into a professional 24-bit recording studio \u0096 all in one box. A REAL MIXER Unlike standard computer I/O boxes based on a patch bay concept, the Lexicon Omega Studio is designed and built around the same paradigm as large-format recording consoles. An 8-input, 4-Bus, 2-output USB I/O mixer with inserts, instrument input, MIDI I/O and complete metering and monitoring functions gives you the freedom to record up to 4 tracks at once and mix without the need for additional mixing hardware.  Two dbx Silver Series\u00ae mic preamps with 48V phantom power provide a pristine front end for high-end condenser or more common dynamic microphones, insuring premium sound quality from the first take to the last. TRS insert points allow you to plug in your favorite dynamic processors before the signal reaches one of the 4 busses, where 24-bit converters transform the analog signal into a digital masterpiece.  Four servo-balanced TRS line inputs with up to +22dBu input levels let you hook up everything from keyboards to guitar preamps, including high-output professional gear. Stereo digital inputs are available via SPDIF jacks, and an additional high-impedance instrument input is included on the front panel for easy access to guitars and basses.  Finally, a fully opto-isolated MIDI input to ensures that there is no annoying ground loop hum or MIDI talk-through noise common with many I/O boxes and sound cards; MIDI output has rock-solid synchronization to USB frame rate to support applications requiring critical sync.  The Omega I/O mixer also features channel peak indicators for each analog input as well as an assignable bargraph meter for the 4 busses. By monitoring the signal before the A/D converters, clipping and distortion can be averted, unlike software-only level monitoring that can miss \"overs\", ruining the track.  All these gazintas and getoutzas are put together just like a big recording console, with input gain controls, four recording busses, and full monitoring features, in one attractive, portable I/O Mixer. Just plug it into your Mac or PC computer with the included USB cable, and you\u0092re instantly ready to capture the moment.
